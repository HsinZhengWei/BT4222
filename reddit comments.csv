"The market is not rational when it comes to the Cupertino crew. Add the recent market turmoil and volatility and you‚Äôve got a lot of uncertainty amplified. Depending on your situation you could borrow against your holdings and enter an options trade. Do an options straddle through the earnings, take your profits post earnings to pay your expenses.

"I believe it will be a bloodbath 

Long term this year don‚Äôt expect much

Split adjusted the shares may retreat to 2019 prices as the stim juicing is gone the economy is worse than 2019 and now we have inflation recession which we didn‚Äôt in 2019.  My logic is sound 

My calls for this year were pretty good crushing numbers and making calls.  I expect mid to high 2 digits as the ‚Äò23 low.  Spy I think retreats another 100 points to 275

Investors I think are going to have difficulty wrapping their minds around this until they realize and embrace much lower forward multiples. 5x not 10-20 x.  Great stock great product bad times skittish buyers including those with more disposable income.  

This bad news arc is not done by a long shot so keep your powder dry.  Investors don‚Äôt have to invest every week or even every month to be called investors.  Meanwhile park your in vesting cash in a liquid 4% acct

Also it is questionable when the fed overshoots and starts cutting and things get bad and government offers ‚Äúsome‚Äù stimulus that it will be a buyers party.  While it looks like inflation has peaked it is likely to spike one more time in 23 before deflation rips at things

"Not a holder response 

New buyer (you know, the investors that eventually drive up the price together)

Bought a couple at 141 142 

Apple did well enough.  The guidance is lower so todays reaction settling around 142-144 is not the low

Traditionally with less than stellar guidance the stock retreats historically after a read out like this.  Anywhere between 2-6% is my take but not right away 

Once again bites at the Apple to increase a position in the 130-137 area.

My take last quarter was the high would be 150-151 at the earning date ‚Äî pretty close 

Interestingly a chart shows the 130-137 area

I believe that big funds want a 20% aapl take at the Santa rally ‚Äî so 137 offers a 10% rally to 150.50.  I wouldn‚Äôt expect much more of a high than 155-165

A 20% gimme to this area of the 150‚Äôs needs a 125 price ‚Äî so those are my target areas to buy and hold 

137, 130, 125.  I won‚Äôt buy anything over 155 and will let whatever shares I collect below 155 this quarter ride to Santa‚Äôs house exit this tax year",yf2rxp

"From my info sifting as a buyer of stock with new money versus a holder of lower priced shares ‚Äî I see the 22 bottom as in.  

If you bought any equities the last few reversals I think those stocks like aapl Nvda Amzn Adbe czr Msft etc will perform okay leading up to the nov fed reveal 

I am reading analysis that suggests this nov .75 will be the last this high.  

The bet will be .50 or .25 in December.  Obviously.25 is bullish psychologically though not factually 

That would set up the Santa rally on all the lower reversal priced equities if you bought and held them.  

I do think a 2022 bottom was reached.  

But not the bottom.  

I think when the lower fed bike comes in December everyone will swoon into the market for that Claus  rally 

But here is the kicker ‚Äî from my research That rally will die a bloody death with a lower than 2022 low sometime in February.

With some analysts projecting 190 and most at least 175-180 and some $83-125, you have a range on a very very safe stock if you don‚Äôt panic and patently buy below $150.  Anything above $150 is fine but not enough % for me with my year estimate 175

Use charts understand volume and read lots of news pro and con

Within this range I am
A buyer because I have great certainty that apple holds a future 1 year share price of $150.  Because the trend is down through 2023 according to read from Powell - with a plan they say lasts till 2025, caution is advised unless you plan to hold multiple years like most on this thread 

the hardest path for an investor buyer seller will be the next 15 months w apple 

Like other companies that seemed immune from misses, apple can miss too, if buyers get spooked and hold off on this years ‚Äúisland gimmick‚Äù upgrade

"My take is it is always a decent buy at lower prices, but i would not throw a Lot of cash at it yet.  

Sept is seasonally the weakest month  -- using a histogram you can see this seasonal weakness over time repeat itself.  From what I have read 140-145 might be offered

the economy and further fed moves this Tuesday and Wednesday  and then the later release of fed minutes will definitely have an effect on the market.  

The last several fed hikes have seen head fake rises and the quick sell offs days late as further tightening is estimated

Right now the stock market has been for day traders getting in and out.  Some big guns at big banks and investment houses have suggested a flat  10years. I don't expect that at all.

But I do expect a recession and further bigger fed rate hikes and these will affect apple stock price short term.  I also have a contrarian view on the fed letting those hikes stay in place for longer than mr market suggests 

 It's all guessing based on reading lots of sources that I agree and disagree with

Blabbering cut short, you will do best if you dca slow
Y through this year and the next.  It's less thrilling but your chances of green success are greater historically 

There are some free trading platforms that let you auto buy stocks once a week,every two weeks or once a month.  Over time you let it run providing you keep depositing money in the account

Even the best companies in the world are not immune from what the fed does

Their idea is a total disruption of mobility and likely has a reoccurring $$ subscription model that would send apple shares literally to the moon.

My take aligns with some analysts long guess of 2027 as the apple car debut. It is more likely later than sooner. I am becoming more convinced after reading government papers and mobility papers that a full scale revolution of mobility is coming and it has not even begun to be manufactured

"Watched Jackson hole tightening longer speech 

I read Powell speech to mean we will be retesting lows, for several reasons. 

Powell mentioning the failures of the fed in the ‚Äú1970‚Äôs‚Äù suggests a tighter for longer fed stance.  

In the 70‚Äôs the fed tried to tame inflation by veering back and forth from tightening to loosening so much that they worsened the situation 

So the fed thesis is  ‚Äútighter-longer‚Äù to avoid 70‚Äôs historical botching by loosening too soon

I believe this will offer some discount prices to aapl buyers in the near future 

I think it is highly reasonable to expect the S&P to return to a 3700 buy point ‚Äî you can see where aapl was at 3700 S&P and pretty much plan some discounted (from todays) buy price

Catalyst side; lots of new products but not any new categories that will move the needle (a $3000 headset will excite but not print lots of cash - and aapl friendly mark gurman says apple glass is years away)

And remember, inflation and then recession means less buying of expensive items because the fed goal is to make money more expensive amd lower wages 

Pretty simple",vedypt
"Me/you 

Ask yourself if you are going to buy new air pod pros:
Yes

Are you going to buy a new iPad Pro if you already own one just to get mchip?  Me: no

Are you going to buy a new iPad Air for someone?  Me: no.  Their iPads work just fine 

Are you going to buy a new MacBook Pro?  I edit multi stream video and audio. Me: no

Are you going to buy a $3000 VR headset ?  Me, no

Will I buy new iPhone 14 pro max? Me, yes. I‚Äôm on the yearly upgrade ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù plan 

Will you buy the new Mac mini m2?  Me, no.  I am waiting for max studio to go on sale

Will you buy the new 30‚Äù Cinema Display? Me, no. Too spendy but I would love it 

Would I buy apple glasses?  Me, maybe 2nd/3rd generation. 

Would I buy the mythic apple car? Big maybe 

This helps me decide how bullish I am given our current environment 

Therefore I have taken massive profit back at $179-180, happily paid my taxes and have a cleared cash reserve heading into troubled waters

I have instituted a vastly smaller mid 5 digit position with a dca of 135

Bearish short term 

Bullish long term 

There are simple fundamental ways to assess apple 

Insiders negative selling shares by 25%

Big funds expect bearish action around tech and retail

Inflation and recession make buyers more careful with their money driving down overall demand 

Coming higher unemployment is part of the fed rate rising plan 

Then I ask myself as a full believer in apple products when I will refresh all my apple tech and the answer is above.  Bearish

BUT THIS IN NO WAY MEANS I am down on the stock. 

Great company and products. My only criticism is Tim Cook‚Äôs incrementalism (which printed lots of profit for me over the years ). I wish they were more daring with acquisitions and new product spaces but oh well 

Good luck on your investments. 

I will say this.  Don‚Äôt bet against apple. 75% of the few times I did, I lost in those moves. But I‚Äôve always been vested with them.  And I never short. I just look for bigger wins lower on the price range",vedypt

At the current price AAPL is on sale and is a solid bargain buy.",v5ckf8
"Re AAPL
the bottoming at $132 with both a bullish candle and bearish rejection candle both formed from that low. 

An immediate break of $151 could form a bullish three-wave pattern to $170 

while an immediate break of $132 will see new lows towards the wave one target bearing of $117.

Apple posting a new high above $182 before touching the $117 target would render the third wave a fail

Look for bullish reversal patterns if the third wave completes at $117 or lower.",v5ckf8
Tldr : could go either way. Here‚Äôs some ads,uw23yl
"As I have been saying all week, Putin aside we really dont have a huge economic problem, this is nowhere near 2008, the China shutdowns will end any day now, the consumers are still hungry for iPhones and Apple will have one or two lousy quarters then it will off to the races again for the best company on earth, now with a low PE.  

So if you have big losses in other stocks, take your tax losses there then re-invest into AAPL.    I bet Buffett has been buying heavily, as has apple itself, and anyone who didn't cover their shorts on Friday is in big trouble now.  I predict AAPl will surge back into the 150's now, assuming China reopens, and then will resume stellar growth and awesome profitability. It has been a tough two months, but that kind of sell-off for AAPl is always a buying opportunity, no reason to throw in the towel.",uw23yl
"If you have additional cash I would not sell. It will return to 175-185

I have been incrementally buying on the way down. 

I wouldn‚Äôt sell aapl into a loss as it‚Äôs worth more than 165. I would add on these lows",uvcpsf
Accumulate. You‚Äôll be so happy in 10 years. I‚Äôm just buying as much MSFT and AAPL as I can,uvcpsf
Nobody knows what price AAPL will drop or increase up to in the next few weeks months but if you plan to hold 2+ years. Dont sell and keep DCA.,uvcpsf
"Joining the chorus. Hold for the long term. Strong balance sheet, cash position, hardware, and a growing service business. iPhone still dominant, AR opportunity for glasses, and car could be revolutionary. Some speculation, but strong record in delivering stable, amazing products.",uvcpsf
"You heard that huh?   So did it.  Well it is true that experts on CNBC guess that 125 is the bottom for AAPL if the market continues selling off, but those same guys are likely hoping for 130-135 they can go all in themselves.  

Nobody knows but 165 to 135 is pretty good in today's market, only a 25% drop, and AAPL was at 112 about 13 months ago when I bought a million worth so it is still holding relatively strong.  In fact, the January nAAPl rally seemed unwarranted, and my entire wealth is because I always bought AAPl during extreme selloffs and it always recovered sharply.  Plus remember that those probably buying down here include Buffett and apple itself. So you are in excellent company if you buy now.

Now I am down 2 million since January with my 52,000 shares (ouch) but with the imminent China shutdown end and the next gen iPhones coming soon plus Apple's enormous pricing power and supply chain mastery this sell off already seems overdone and I expect 160+ again within six months. I also expect over 200 next year or once this whole doom and gloom thing and Putin's sicko war are over.

I would actually buy more, not sell. Don't touch a share, or if you are holding other losers which are less secure than AAPL, why not take a loss on those and flip the money into new AAPl shares.  At around 135 I don't see how you can lose, at least not medium to longer term.",uvcpsf
Do what Buffett did and buy more,uvcpsf
"I‚Äôve been following AAPL for years and holding for years as well. There always seems to be a pretty significant dip in the Spring‚Ä¶ around end of Q1-beginning of Q2 (calendar). My wife can quote me calling it the ‚ÄúSpring dip‚Äù. IMO, AAPL has never been a short term play, so holding is a better strategy than selling now and re-buying. My experience has been that when you hold AAPL long enough, these dips stop scaring you. 
**NOT financial advice**",uvcpsf
No need to panic sell unless you seriously need the cash short term. Think about your goals when investing in AAPL and what you truly think the value is. I personally think it‚Äôs well above your average and would hold.,uvcpsf
"never, keep it long term",uvcpsf
"You want to sell at a loss?

What's your time horizon? Do you need the money?",uvcpsf

"I consider this Huberty news something sensitive sellers may over react to,  offering the buyer a signal to watch for at earnings if App Store $ craters.

Huberty: ‚Äúa deceleration in App Store growth likely points to fading consumer spending on goods/
services that accelerated during the pandemic. While we are bullish on the longer-term App Store and Services outlook, a deceleration in App Store growth (and monetization) could be a near-term headwind to results.‚Äù

"A 3 wave structure is coming to take this to 117

Apple is smart and will not introduce new consumer goods during a recession. So 2 cycles to hunt 3 cycles to buy 30 months",uvcpsf
"AAPL is probably the #1 stock to buy now for stability and security.  The next quarter will be messy but after that things should settle down and as soon as Putin ends his evil war, Apple will surpass Aramco and become the world's most valuable company again, probably surpassing three trillion market cap within two years.",uvcpsf

I think what was most surprising to me for a sub where you‚Äôre trying to share ideas, was the absolute certainty of most holders here that this 150 range wouldn‚Äôt never become available again. And that rate hikes and inflation and supply wouldn‚Äôt matter

They matter as an investor 

From my chart and inflation  and the probability of the fed‚Äôs hiking  3 more x‚Äôs(.50x1, .75X1 and full point x1) this stock still has farther to fall over the next 3 months before the annual June to sept pump

Lol your source link to the 3.5 mm jack is just a poll on a forum. There is literally no reason apple will reintroduce the headphone jack since they sell an adapter.

"Inflation news has really kept AAPL muted this week.  Is it going to matter next week what AAPL reports?  I feel it's going to keep trading sideways or lower no matter what AAPL says; some analyst isn't going to be happy about something, especially the guidance.  And Cook & Co. have always been conservative (honest?) about the outlook of the upcoming quarter based on reality and there are still COVID lockdowns, still an invasion going on disrupting the region and the global economy...not to mention 1970's style inflation.

I've been selling calls at the $182.50+ strikes because I don't think there is any chance in hell the stock will be at $3T valuation no matter what comes out next week unless they unveil the AR glasses during the meeting or drop the EV.  I'm also selling puts in the $165 and below; my guess is the stock will make a slight run up to earnings through Thursday and stay flat or pull back a bit on Friday.

"Cook is right.  If IOS allowed unregulated aps to skirt their rules, it would be dangerous from consumers.  Apple does charge hefty commissions, but they also deliver the customers which more than make up for it.  I used to be an Amazon seller and used to gripe about their 15% commission and sometimes cruel draconian rules, but if I had used a different platform I wouldn't have made even 10% of what I made on Amazon because they deliver the customers from all over the world and you dont even need to advertise.  Also, IOS is the safest, most secure, most difficult to hack and protects your private data better than any other. 

As for Google, Microsoft and facebook, it is sometimes fine that their AI seems to anticipate what you want to buy next and assist you that way, but it does bother me that they know so much about me in the most private ways and that they could potentially exploit that. That is just creepy. And the Metaverse, assuming it ever gets going, will probably make this intrusion even worse.

Reality is going to hit with the double 50 basis points rate hike in May and June then further more throughout rest of the year.

The mythical $200 is almost a year away

Fair value for a flattish investment is 159-170. Add the very cautious Cook, general world outlook rising rates etc and it‚Äôs easy to make low buy in calls. Big firms want 25% on this stock and in tandem they can drive the price to levels that see them perform for their managers and clients.  It almost works like magic if you are patient 

Even for apple pie in the skyers $200 suggests the stock retests 150.  If 175 is the new base, it suggests a 25% drop from there to $131.25.  Historically this makes a lot of sense if you shoot out to a 2 year chart. You can see the cycle and % pullbacks regardless of the company health

"Geopolitical uncertainty has impacted the markets and it could get worse. There is a path for Apple to reach $250 by 2024, but $100 could be in the cards.
If China invades Taiwan there is no way to predict what the global response or ramifications would be. Apple is dependent on TSM making an invasion devastating for its business.
The market changed the game and is focused on growing EPS and FCF rather than revenue growth. AAPL has generated more than $100 billion over the TTM in both.
AAPL can manufacture increases in EPS by retiring shares and has several catalysts for revenue growth on the horizon.

Bottom line,  we have a duty to militarily defend Taiwan.  A war there could easily send share prices below $100 a share for many reasons 

I warned of this before to perma apple bulls and was laughed at.  In fact, many investors here said we would never retest the 150‚Äôs

Taiwan dominates the chip foundry market so think about that and an invasion and what that means 

Our hope is that Ukraine may have given pause to china but I fear it will actually be a motivator to get an invasion done in this situation

63% of chip production originates in Taiwan.  With china‚Äôs 7% of chips, an invasion would make them the owner of record for over 70% of chip production AFTER AN INVASION

Earnings and AAPL are tricky! The report greatly and the stock drops the same day.  Happened the last to earnings report.,sdcpkw
"stock has dropped after great earnings the past 4 times, but of course since I want the stock to stay below $165 this week it will surely pop off!",sdcpkw
"MSFT posted an 18% growth quarter with a 32 PE and got taken down 5% after hours. Now AAPL must do better than MSFT with at least a 21% growth number or sadly it too will fall, unless the current fall has already priced that in. Hard to tell as AAPL has retreated to a 28 PE which is quite reasonable and even cheap for it. 

 I predict AAPL will do better than MSFT.  Why? Because MSFT only has a few christmas products, mostly the Xbox and they were in short supply, much worse than any supply shortage of Apple's.  I remember back in October a MSFT exec said to hurry and buy your Xbox for christmas now because they are running out.  So Xbox sales were relatively poor in december.  But has anyone heard about not being able to get an iPHone or Mac? Instead I heard Apple had largely solved its supply chain slowdown.

Expect AAPl to be on sale tomorrow at around 157.  That is a buy, but buyer's in today's market are very skittish so expect to have to wait for earnings to get a pop.  If they beat handily though, like they have many times before, we should be back to a 30-31 PE level which means the mid 170's.   Oh yeah and the Fed reports tomorrow too. So igt whatever they say already priced in or will it spur or depress the overall market? Another big question.

I should have too but I was literally an infant,s6da6l
Gonna drop due to lowering expectations cause of supply chain.. $150s I would say over next few weeks,s56sm9
"Now we are seeing a weak and cynical market for Apple and all techs going into earnings. Assuming earnings are fine (which I do in Apple's case) that may set up to become a post earnings rally, exactly the opposite of what happened in many previous quarters. it all depends where the stock is going into earnings .

So far the 168-170 area has held three times lately. My guess is that Apple itself is buying back heavily just below 170. If so that is the floor and a new bottom tested and established.  If not then the whole market is collapsing and that would be an even better buying op though very painful for those enduring it. 

I don't need the money since I am a wealthy longterm holder but I ask myself at what price would I go $1,000,000 on margin to buy AAPL and feel 95% confident and sleep well at night?  I think $155, because at that price I believe that Apple itself and many other whale buyers would be joining me. But picking the bottom is always lucky timing.  I picked right 9 months ago at $118, but what is the new bottom?   I know one thing, it is above $150 and probably right about where we are today.",s56sm9
"Again, historically there is no pattern. If the stocks runs up unto earnings and earnings are in any way disappointing yes there will be a dip. But often just the opposite happens, there is selling or downgrading before earnings by bears or dishonest brokers (Wells Fargo, Keybanc come to mind as culprits) predicting problems and that depresses the stock price a little before earnings, then the earnings come out and if everyone is pleasantly impressed the stock goes up, or if the earnings are a little disappointing as they were a few quarters ago there is a sell-off but then  re-examination of the facts and the stock rises again.

Every earnings reaction is different and it all depends. Let's say AAPl stays at 172 and bears caution us about problems,  but the problems turn out not to exist (typically). Then the stock does to 190+.  But if the stock runs before earning toward190 then some profit taking sell on the news takes place, or anything inbetween.

So far we have only three credible clues as to earnings this quarter they are all buliish but the stock is down 10 points in the last 3 weeks on an overall tech selloff.  So if the bullish case turns out to be true we could be looking at over 200 within a month or so.  Or if not, then not, but I would not bet on AAPL going below the recent double bottom of 168-169. Not unless there is some bad news no one expected like mess than stellar guidance.",s56sm9
tsmc is a makor aapl supplier yhat just beat earnings and went UP not down. if apple had dupply chain problems then so wouldtsmc and they dont. this is also a good sign for swks which is very undervalued nowaapl and swks are both buys. apple will likely beat on top and bottom lines as they have just bpught back 12 billion worth in one month on the two dips to 169 which seems to be the floor now.,s56sm9
"I expect it to pump ahead of earnings, and agree it will drop back after earnings. Guessing below 170 for a bit after. I wonder if we‚Äôll test the $3T again prior to earnings.",s56sm9
Most stocks dip after earnings and would not be surprised here. $AAPL has good support around 168 area as it has bounced 2x there so far. I see a climb to 177/180 area and then big pullback to 168/170 area after earnings. Play the trend lines and always take some profit.,s56sm9

"Danger is far from over: This Is Historically A Bad Time To Buy Apple

From Sean Chandler

A technology stock with a P/E of 30 and a $3 trillion valuation doesn't sound like a safe haven.
Apple's recent gross margins of more than 40% are unlikely to hold.
Apple has been volatile and buying at the peak vs. trough of the last 4 dips is a ROI difference of 100-600% vs. 200%-1200%.

I'm not here to suggest anyone sell, but rather tell those buying to wait for better opportunities. 

Apple has already fallen 5% since reaching the $3 trillion market cap, but that's NOT the opportunity I'm talking about.

I believe active money will take their win and search for new opportunities should they find a reason to take some Apple off the table, and I have two.

Reduced gross margins & iPhone shipments for '22-'23
This isn't the first time I made this claim against Apple. The last handset Jobs had control over brought Apple's gross margins to a record 47% thanks to a Siri-enabled iPhone 4S. This advantage didn't last long though due to competition. Large-display Android devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 were competitive (and different) and Apple's margins quickly retreated below 40%. A few years later, Apple again topped 40% and I called it unsustainable because it wasn't backed by innovation. Instead, Apple still relied on customers spending an extra $100 to upgrade from a 16GB iPhone (6/6S) to 32GB, or $200 for a 64GB model. A year later, the infamous 16GB entry-level model was doubled, and a 64GB option was now half the price. ASPs fell until Apple launched the $999 iPhone X, which boosted profits but didn't help margins due to the high cost of replacing an LCD display with OLED.

This time, Apple's margins are up due to higher volumes caused by the pandemic. For years, analysts have been calling for a ""super cycle"", or a rapid upgrade cycle for customers holding onto their iPhones for far longer than expected. The iPhone 6S/7 cycle is still the highest-volume two-year period of iPhone unit sales. The stay-at-home, work-from-home lifestyle was a good reason to upgrade. Fortunately, for anyone buying an iPhone 12 or 13, they're upgrading to what will likely be future-proof phones for many years.

These models are all 5G capable, have outstanding cameras, and all new iPhone models (rather than just the ""Pro"" devices) come with OLED displays. I suspect that these customers will be holding onto their phones for even longer than last time. Even an iPhone 13 Pro is a hard sell compared to an iPhone 11 Pro or XS.

I'm expecting Apple to announce that they've sold around 100-million iPhones over the most recent holiday quarter. Apple's iPhone install base has certainly grown since it announced reaching a billion units last year, but 100-million units is close to 10% of their overall install base. In January 2019, Apple announced that its' install base was over 900 million, and the holiday quarter before that they sold 68 million iPhones or just 7.5% of their total install base.

I suspect that over the next few years, Apple will need to cater to new lower-margin products (such as a 5G iPhone SE) and see volumes drop compared to 2021's record sales. As such, I see margins in decline and investors panic-selling as they've done historically after Apple hits new all-time highs.

(Here is the historic part hodlers and new buyers need to be aware of 

Sean continues:

A historically 'bad' time to buy Apple
As a long-term investment, there's never been a bad time to buy Apple. However, Apple has been more volatile than the indexes, sometimes dipping while they keep roaring. This is atypical of most stocks in the Dow such as Apple because Apple is a unique business. It's in a highly competitive market and there's always the fear that Apple will lose its competitive advantage. It's never happened yet, but every time there are signs that it could be, the stock has fallen. Over the last decade, we've seen Apple pullback 30-40% while the indexes climbed higher most of the time.

(let‚Äôs examine what I have been posting on this sub: apple routinely pulls back 39-40% before scaling higher - as Sean noted above)

Here is the historical 30-40% pullback history 

In 2012, Apple shares fell nearly 40% while the S&P 500 continued to march higher. This was after Apple's margins contracted from a record 47% down to 37%. At the time, just a year after Jobs' passing, investors wondered if Apple could fend off the competition.

In 2015, Apple fell over 30% over the course of a year while the S&P 500 marched higher. Apple's revenue growth slowed sharply, margins contracted, and EPS downtrended despite the overall growth of the company.

In 2018, after topping the trillion-dollar mark, Apple fell over 30% over several months. Apple's decline far outpaced the macro environment, where the Dow lost 11%, the S&P500 lost 18%, the NASDAQ lost 20%.

In 2020, Apple fell 30% at the beginning of the pandemic, which is mostly in-line with the macro environment.

(A BETTER BUY PRICE AHEAD VERY LIKELY)

Of course, no one can time the market but a difference in capturing Apple at the trough of these dips after it peaked is a ROI difference of 2-7x (peak) and 3-13x (trough). Again, you can't time the market, but if history repeats itself as it often has, there will again be an opportunity to buy Apple. Should my guesses on Apple's 2022/2023 slowdown in sales growth and reduction in margins hold any merit, I believe there will be a good opportunity for investors.

A 25% pullback from fridays price is 130. 

Happy lucrative aapl investing to all!",rxi8ia
wrong! aapl is growing robustly in evrry product category average 25% plus they buy back tons of shares.,rxi8ia
"A week later and another tech selloff.  Naz down 400 points or 2.5% but you can see AAPL holding up quite well, only down 1.9% which is kind of a lot but it is still holding that 172 area.  Apple earnings out 1/27 so coming soon.  If the earnings are what I think they are we will see new highs.  SWKS also an excellent buy here, taken down with the tech high-fliers though it is priced as a value stock with a 17 PE.  It might actually be a better way to play Apple as the upside could be quite a bit more.",rxi8ia

Where does the stock go now that it hit 3 trillion briefly? Does it just moon up regardless of profit or loss or larger Econ issues?

AR VR EV profits are so far away from booking into quarters. I will stay away from this stock deep into 2022 for a whole host of reasons. Capex spending is so weak.  EPS estimates weaker still.  Headwinds are strong.  Anyone buying at 180 is going to have to hold for a long time to see meaningful profit.  30% gain on 180 means apple needs to sit at $254 a share in the next few quarters.

I would have like an extra +$50 by now if I didn't sell that portion, big whoop! If I hadn't reentered at that point, I never would have reentered.

However with the ongoing microchip shortages it is smart for apple to create their own supply. AAPL may also want to buy SWKS, sometimes it is faster and cheaper to buy a supplier rather than try to replace it.plus SWKS has a brilliant digital health-medical division that would be a perfect for for Apple.

It is a fact that many tech companies can't justify the high PE's they've had, especially all those crypto and SPAC type Cathie Woods stocks, some big ones like TSLA too.

These new categories and revenue streams are worth $600 a share 5 years if executed well.  Apple executes brilliantly 

Price history: Apple has been higher than $300 a share pre-split so people are willing to pay for it as the company expands.  

buy point

Yes Apple will EVENTUALLY HOLD rather than just touch $200 a share. 

If you have shares bought below a split price of $80 a share there‚Äôs no reason to sell except to book profit at some future date 
 
In my thesis from all my research and looking at charts I‚Äôm interested in 

new shares between 141 and 144 on the very lowest side it could possibly go 

150 to 153 in the middle range 

165-166 is the highest price I am willing to pay for new shares

It‚Äôs instructive to do research and take a look at chart action, track those peaks and valleys as it relates to the cycle of their performance as a company and  news stories.

Traders at large firms have told me that Apple will be available in the 140s as the market corrects with several interest rate hikes on the horizon. The question you have to ask yourself on any slight pullback is ‚Äî is the stock pulling back enough to enter a new large position.

The medium price forecast for the stock is 169 not 200.  That forecast takes into mind where the overall price will be with at least 2 interest rate hikes.  A 10% haircut on a 169 price is $152.  Big funds want more than 10%.  Even factoring in a higher price with apples cyclical 15-20% dip a better price is suggested in the 150‚Äôs.  

I think it‚Äôs ludicrous to read posts here saying definitively apple will not touch $150.  So not with 2 interest rate hikes and maybe a down quarter?  Not ever?  Funds and savvy investors will sell off on interest rate hikes, apple may have a down quarter in the beginning of 22

182.5 is the number for 3 trillion. It might continue pumping for a bit,rdz56i
"It‚Äôs not a healthy pump IMO. Apple is a long term investments and not a meme stock. The last time apple went north of 30PE, it came crashing down pretty hard. The signal for over bought has been triggered for a few days now. I‚Äôm a long term apple investor as well and my average is around $80 ish. I think I will cash out on some profit and re buy after the dip. Friday was clearly a pump to cover the calls. If the feds do decide to finally stop kicking the can down the road and do something about this hot inflation then these tech stocks will have have a huge correction. All these hype about AR/VR, Apple Car, 3 trillion cap‚Ä¶ Tim Cook himself said supply chain is an issue and will hurt IPhone 13 sales. The sharks tend to increase the TP when there‚Äôs an uptrend to fool more people into buying at a high price and leave them hanging holding bags in the end. I still remember these institutions were giving apple a Tp of $110 and $90 when the I12 came out lol‚Ä¶ clearly they wanted to drive the price down so they can buy for cheaper now they‚Äôre doing in reverse. Trying to get people to jump in the ‚Äú 3 trillion‚Äù market cap and end up leaving poor retailers holding bags. Sell incrementally as these sharks fry to jack up the price and take profit and increase position again when the price makes sense again. Another reason is money is flowing out of crypto. Once money is back in crypto then these tech stocks will have a correction again. Don‚Äôt be left holding bags if you‚Äôre a new investor in apple. And take profit on this non sense pump.",rdz56i
"AAPL is definitely in overbought territory for the short term. I‚Äôm expecting a correction back to $150s and even possibly $140s (highly unlikely) before buying the dip as an AAPL bull.

AAPL is a great company but at $3T a lot of things have to continue to go right like new untapped growth markets. AAPL is a safe haven, anyone not buying AAPL when it was underperforming in the first half and buying at these prices is FOMO like August 2020.

"Great company 

But past is precedent with apple as long term holders know.  Don‚Äôt trade hold makes sense time and again. Also not getting overly emotional about positions.  Apple still has 3 great new categories ahead as the Metaverse expands and EV culture kills the ICE for wide spread mobility use. 

That said ‚Äî there are warnings ahead as always. Don‚Äôt need to list them for long term investors vs traders 

The charts and potential misses for even one quarter can open the opportunity for large holders to take profit and send the stock down .  From 157 earlier to 138.  Or the 155 to 142.  Or the 135 to the 120s several times even though we knew it was crazy and should have held mid 130‚Äôs on the way to 150 & 200

My point is there is just as likely a beat as a miss.  For new money versus cheaper hold money in the stock I have charted the old apple tip top drop patterns. If news or misses send the stock back I want 1000 more shares.  That area is a high 149-166.  Bought in expanding lots on the way down in theory it would DCA out to about 155.

Aapl is definitely headed to 3 trill and beyond when they dominate off world colonies and offer subscription space travel

"There are always pullbacks with aapl.  Remember the run up to high 130‚Äôs tops a year ago? It hit that top 3 times and pulled back to 117-120 areas multiple times  over a year before busting through to 150‚Äôs and now 160‚Äôs

Because their important 2021 holiday quarter reports in beg of 2022, the cycle would say hold toward that catalyst

But it is just as likely to sell off if their forward looking estimates from forward quarters have cloudy estimates based on reality.  When aapl hit those 3 130‚Äôs tops they were all leading up to events. 

With lots of deep economic challenges that directly affect aapl share prices like higher interest rates, supply side and shipping and material challenges, as well as traditionally slowing quarters, will most likely offer apple at 140.  Big firm experts have told me as much  

Look at todays chart. None of us retailers could pull off todays flash sell to $112 that then sprung back to the 160‚Äôs.  Its the move large firms and flash sellers create for themselves.  The struggle is real 

Watch closely",r5wjao
"This also concerns me and may be a red flag

From Bloomberg: ‚ÄúApple has informed some of its component suppliers that demand for the iPhone 13 models is slowing ahead of the holidays‚Äù reports Bloomberg. Reports of weakening demand come as delivery estimates for the ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå and 13 Pro have started to improve.  The difference between 12 pro and 13 is minimal. People may be buying their own dip by purchasing the perfectly awesome discounted 12",r5wjao
That‚Äôs a smart system of thought.  How do you negate your tax by selling after a 1 year period year.  Are you keeping your realization of profit lower per year for tax brackets?,r5wjao
"While I like a long position on stocks like AAPL, I usually sell when they pass 1 year period for tax purposes. Then I buy them back. You won‚Äôt realize the gain unless you sell it so my idea is to realize the gain when it‚Äôs a long position.
By the way: this is just my idea and not necessarily the right one. I still own AAPL and have been buying and selling several times- so far so goodüòÜ.",r5wjao

If FB reports a big drop in revenues based on this new paradigm then it could fall 100 points. Also I do not buy or believe in the Metaverse. That tech does not exist yet and if anyone can build a wonderful alt augmented reality space where you are not preyed upon it is Apple not FB. In fact that might be what is going on behind the scenes in the Apple vs FB feud.  Also, though Instagram is super successful, facebook is fading out and whatsap is used everywhere but doesn't make any money.  So there is a reason Facebook is the most hated company and Apple is the most revered and I'd rather not support Mark Zuckerberg.",qzuniu

"Own it don't trade it as Kramer says. Every time I trim some of my AAPL I regret it, usually reinvesting it into something more boring (safe I thought) and that stock underperforms AAPL.  Or I sell too fast like I did at 139.   But luckily I sold less than 5% of it.  -- Yes I disobey the cardinal rule, I do not diversify. -- Last time I bought AAPL I sold my house early this year for $950,000 and put the money into AAPL and was lucky to snag $118 which was the low of that particular covid induced dive. So nice swing trade on those 6500 shares. I sold 1500 nat 139, a mistake, and still hold 5000.  I have 55,000 in all.  Some I bought at the pit of the 2008 collapse.  Most of my shares were bought in the $17-34 range mostly right after Steve Jobs died when the market ""experts"" told us Apple was finished without their leader. ""No innovation"" and cheap smart phones would kill them.   I thought about that, realized Jobs knew he was dying for two years and hadn't been well enough to work all year, and had handpicked Tim Cook as his successor. So I figured F it, trust Steve, and went on margin for a million bucks and bought up a ton of AAPL. Then of course it went down again and I cringed. I even got a margin call and was forced to sell a little to pay for it, then lo and behold I just held and added on dips and now for the first time in my life I have 10 million bucks. Eight figures, bro!   So I feel very good about holding my AAPL and expect, yes it will pass $200 sometime fair soon.",qzszu9

"Hurrah for AAPL holders, new all-time high.  Now sure what the catalyst is, maybe they will build the car and that challenges Tesla, but I have been pointing out for a long time that AAPL is a superior company to MSFT in all ways, and yet Wall St has given MSFT a 30% higher PE and even a higher market cap.  The Street has also given GOOGL a slightly higher PE.  That never made any sense. Nothing against MSFT but just look at the numbers, and also realize that Apple has the most loyal, youngest, most tech savvy, most active and affluent customers. MSFT does not.  MSFT has its cloud service of course, a hugely successful part of the company, but Apple is moving more into cloud enterprise and also challenging Google, Facebook and Amazon by moving more and more into (ethical) advertising.  Their new game arcade with Disney also shows they are challenging Microsoft and Sony in games.  So if anyone can build an ethical Metaverse it is Apple not Facebook.  Plus, Apple has secrets weapons with its new super chips. I just learned a lesson, to have faith in Tim Cook and Apple, because every damn time I trim some and buy a ""safer"" stock (I trimmed at 149) the so-called safe stock tanks and AAPL eventually keeps going up. So I left 100 K or more on the table doing that instead of just holding and accumulating AAPL.  But thank God I kept 95% of my AAPL because I just hit 10 million bucks in my portfolio for the first time and it was at 1.5 million just five years ago.",qwv4zi

"Apple stock now has a cup-with-handle base, with a 153.26 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. The handle formed after AAPL stock rebounded from its 50-day line following mixed Apple earnings. But the relative strength line is at its worst levels since late June. More broadly, the RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, has been trending slightly lower since August 2020, reflecting Apple stock's laggard status vs. the S&P 500 index.

Of course, a powerful Apple stock move would quickly revive the RS line. ABNB stock had a lackluster RS line until Friday's surge.


Meanwhile, news broke late Friday that Apple has hired Tesla's former Autopilot software director for its secretive Apple Car effort. C.J.

"*This is a weekly candle chart of AAPL looking back since September of 2020. This chart goes over different features on the TrendSpider platform that help create a unique experience when doing analysis in the markets both on the technical and non-technical side of things. The technical tools used in this case study focus on using ‚Äúmargin of error‚Äù around different technical levels and using historical seasonality as well as analyst sentiment to look at the non-technical view of Apple.*

1. This number shows the anchor point for the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) in May of 2021. This was a point at which a low was put in and a new pivot at the support zone was created. In this case, you can see that there are two lines associated with the anchored VWAP. One of these lines is the actual anchored VWAP and the other line below it is a 2.5% offset which captures some of the wicks below the original anchored VWAP to account for some of the margin of error that occurs around technical levels.
2. This number shows the trend ‚Äúzone‚Äù which also creates an area of potential support rather than an exact trendline and an exact price. The market rarely respects technical levels perfectly which is why highlighting ‚Äúzones‚Äù of interest rather than exact levels gives traders some margin of error when doing technical analysis. 
3. This number shows the historical seasonality for AAPL over the last 13 years which is a measurement since the 2009 financial crisis lows. As you can see, October is the second strong month of the year since 2009 with a 75% win rate. However, going into the end of the year in November and December, that win rate drops down to 58%. A ‚Äúwin rate‚Äù when looking at seasonality on TrendSpider is just measuring how many times a particular period (in this case, months) closed higher than the previous period. In this case, a 75% win rate for October means that October has closed higher than September‚Äôs monthly close 75% of the time since 2009.
4. This number shows the analyst estimates for AAPL over the last year. In this case, you can see that analysts are very bullish on AAPL over the last year with 48 ‚Äúbuy‚Äù ratings, 10 ‚Äúhold‚Äù ratings, and only 1 ‚Äúsell‚Äù rating. This analyst estimates tool on the platform gives you a non-technical view of stocks by seeing the sentiment of professional analysts in the market. In this case, a recent bounce off the anchored VWAP support, bounce off trend zone support, a win rate higher than 50% into November and December, and strong analyst ratings suggest AAPL may be bullish into the end of 2021.",qbbhvr

I don‚Äôt remember the last time where I could just order an iPhone for pick up on the 24th with no issues and apparently there‚Äôs a chip shortage issue for them as well and I13 is still readily available. I suspect their I13 sales will be very disappointing. However, it‚Äôs still a great company but I think there will be a long drop and be stagnant for a long time before another pop because their revenue this year will just be crap. Don‚Äôt forget if the Economy opens up and there will be an excess amounts of iPads and macs floating around hence an even smaller demand for replacement.",pq2mae
There ad revenue will be making up for that.,pq2mae
"I would actually argue, AAPL would actually grow in biz if they allowed people to fix their own devices.

For example, I am an early adopter and want a new phone every year... if it was easy for me to pass on my device to a second buyer (friend/family/CL/whatever)... then I would keep getting the latest device. That 2nd buyer is probably a little more value aware and wants something nice but not too pricy. Eventually that second buyer will say hey let me give this away or sell it to a younger kid or grand parent who doesn't need the best of tech and wants something usable. If I can easily just drop in a new battery that device will live on and more and more people can enter the AAPL ecosystem.

More people in the AAPL ""system"" mean more sales of accessories, parts, supported systems, apple store, etc...

Eventually those lower down the food chain got a taste of what they would like and learned they can have ""newer"" / ""better"" stuff then they will upgrade to a device at a price point they can afford.

The iphone should be the gateway to other apple devices which are the real money generating devices.

If Apple would sell DIY batteries direct to customers... who in their right mind would go to amazon/ebay/corner store to buy an off brand battery? Installing the battery in an iphone is not hard to do, most children can do it.

The point is, allow older tech to work its way down the food chain and live a long and usable life rather than e-waste. I get the incentive for AAPL to stop support of legacy devices, but why not just set a hard limit expiration of the device instead and the value it can scale with that.

For example: I buy an Apple device on Jan 1st 2022 with an expiration date of 5 years. Lets say I buy it for $1000 on day 1, I can expect a decay rate of about 70% of original price every year so...

* Jan 2023 = $1000 x 70% = $700 value
* Jan 2024 = $700 x 70% = $490 value
* Jan 2025 = $490 x 70% = $343 value
* Jan 2026 = $343 x 70% = $240 value
* Jan 2027 = $240 x 70% = $0 item expired

This is not exactly how it should play out but you get the idea of the decay factor in tech. This way AAPL can say the product is expired and no more support. Use at your own risk.

Full disclosure, I YOLO'ed on AAPL",pq2mae

very hard to predict products were a refresh of current products no blistering new product revealed but if you are upgrading from an old phone like the X or earlier the upgrade will be significant with 5G and nice upgrade to camera.

In fact it will likely get back into the 150's and stay there, then start rising again.  The Epic lawsuit is not that bad for Apple.  The judge demanded Apple open up on payments options, but otherwise Apple kind of won the day which is why Epic is appealing.  ""Apple is not a monopoly"" are five words Apple would have paid billions to see worded in a court decision.  Also Apple has the flexibility to adapt and shrugs off new rules. They have many revenue streams they are not even really tapping yet, like advertising.

"Apple is very secretive about this Apple car business but they have invested quite a bit of money in it including hiring away two of Elon Musk's best engineers, and developing next gen batteries which would compete against Tesla. This is why Musk recently sniped at Apple. He can be vindictive and immature, which is one reason I would never invest in anything Musk runs.",p1g0i2

"Tim Cook has repeatedly said that they will deliver products or services that make the lives of customers easier or efficient and the greatest contribution will be to health. I‚Äôm struggling to understand their vision in the auto space where margins are low and relative benefits to society are marginal.

"All stocks fall sometimes, and all also rise.  No one is an ""expert"" on exactly when and no two time periods are the same. Sometimes AAPL goes up around earnings sometimes it goes down and it usually has little to do with the actual earnings results. One thing has always been true though, if nd when AAPL goes down more than 5% it is a buying opportunity, and if it ever goes down 10% it is time to back up the truck an buy all you can.  Now AAPL is around 146, so 10% is 14 points. Can it go down to 132?  Unlikely but some general market sell-off collapse or some major trouble in China, some awful supply chain problem or losing the epic case badly or being ordered to break up the company,  these unlikely but possible events are ""worst case scenarios"" and yes the 10% level is realistic in case of very bad news. But where is the bad news?  The story now is Delta is threatening to semi-close the economy again. That might be very good for AAPL as it was during the shutdowns last year.   So we are nearing the release of the new iPhones and then move on into the christmas and new year. Anyone want to bet against that?  This is actually the period when AAPL historically does best, though yes there will be ups and downs.  I said buy and HOLD.  AAPL is a stock that allows you to sleep well almost every night. And btw my favorite ""expert"" lo  AAPL is Gene Munster and he is banging the table for AAPL to hit $200 within a year.",oyfgeg
"In my opinion, the needle doesn‚Äôt move that much after blowout quarters because the stock climbs steadily throughout the year. I think Apple is one to hold because the real value will be in new breakthrough products (AR, possible car, hardware on subscription) that will hopefully have the same effect on the stock that the iPhone did. Hold this for years and you won‚Äôt regret it!",oyfgeg

Zoom out: there will be more dips. Today‚Äôs  145 might even be a great price.,ougj0j
"check it for yourself, but my memory is that it dips after earning, but then slowly drains down $20-25/share. This time might be different. When things get rocky, money runs to safety and that could keep Apple from retracing back to 120.",ougj0j

"Proof positive that sometimes the traders and markets make no sense at all.  Apple knocked the ball out of the park again and yet again the stock sells off after earnings. It is recovering now but these earnings events are now irrelevant as trading and timing targets. Many times AAPl zoomed up after great earnings, and lately it has dropped. So just buy, hold and ignore the timing on earnings.  And remember, AAPL just made 83 billion in a single quarter and iPhone sales are up 36% and even if that number dips a little in future quarters who cares?  Apple is a monster success and still undervalued.",oss43g
"jesus, if you can't handle -1.60$% you shouldn't be investing at all.",oss43g
Rarely makes sense to play earnings. IV crush will kill you. Sell options during earnings,oss43g
"I did the same thing in January 2021. Bought few calls and through the earning I was up by 2K. But 1 week after the earnings it came down to negative. I bought more calls to average out and essentially kept catching the falling knife. Eventually by March I was 26K down and realized a loss of over 16K. But then April came and with the remaining calls I had I sold all of them before earnings and recovered almost 6K. If only I had not sold my calls for a loss I would have been 20K up. I learnt 2 lessons:

1. Buy naked options is nothing but gambling
2. If you are doing that close your positions before earnings. Realized profit is always better than unrealized profit.

With this strategy I have recovered almost 85% of my loss so far.",oss43g

"I think Apple will drop after earnings even if they‚Äôre incredible.

Probably going to tank on earnings. It usually runs up a bit in the lead up to earnings then dips on earnings. If it DOES go up probably looking at $150-155 I‚Äôd bet given how much volume is needed to move a behemoth like Apple.,oqsvsj
"More times than not, aapl sells off after earnings then claws it‚Äôs way up in the days and weeks afterwards. The post earnings behavior is always  a reaction to the forward guidance they provide. They never hype their forecast and the market sells off. Then analyst come out and revise their price targets based on their research etc‚Ä¶ in short, I‚Äôm planning to sell before earnings announcement. It‚Äôs a delicate dance but you could open another position with expiration in September or October just out of the money then add to it post earnings‚Ä¶",oqsvsj
They‚Äôll print $160 after earnings.,oqsvsj
My guess back to 140 with the run up that happened. Plus evictions and govt shut down fears added in.,oqsvsj
Whens the Earnings Date,oqsvsj
Sell. 160 is high,oqsvsj
"Have to sell 50% first. 

Greed is good only when you bet with your profit.",oqsvsj
140 - peak earnings fears will be realized. Apple slashed prices on flagship products right before their last earnings high. The following period saw lower earnings and now they're having supply issues so it would seem they've both exhausted demand (lowering prices) and even if they hadn't already soaked up demand they're unable to keep up with supply and will be forced to push new product launches.,oqsvsj

LEAPS especially with a stock like Apple.,opkazq
"Unpopular opinion, but I only use LEAPS for large-cap tech stocks. I want more leverage. Simply put, AAPL's dividend is so weak I just don't see it as an attractive stock to hold, not to mention you get far more leverage from LEAPS, and you can even avoid short term capital gains taxes by buying ITM LEAPS with more than one year of runway, then roll out your contract every year and discount taxes. So while I get the tax advantage of holding shares, I prefer LEAPS unless you have a portfolio over $1M, at which point shares might seem more attractive",opkazq
Leaps? Like way out of the money calls? Why not buy like 155 calls or do you consider that a leap,opkazq
"No one knows, but Cramer and I were right that 141 was the bottom the other day, a 4% correction based not on AAPL  but the surging covid cases around the world. Since Apple benefits from shutdowns (or no shutdowns) it turned out to be irrelevant and an over-rection. Meanwhile already undervalued stocks got cheaper, but then speculators bid up bad investments like AMC, cryptos and re-opening plays again. That is where the risk is, not AAPl and now my other undervalued steady strong picks VIAC, T and VZ.  Also as AAPL rises so will SWKS and other Apple suppliers. Also thank God the CHina flood wasn't worse. Apple apparently only lost a few days of productivitiy and can make up for it later.",opfoa5
Buy Ô£ø any day. Timing isn‚Äôt the thing. Ô£ø long.,oolt3i
"Earnings will be excellent but if it runs up before earnings it may drop after. If it doesn't it will probably go up afterward.  I am looking for 154 around earnings myself.  There is some resistance at 150.  also, let's hope the rains stop in China so the factory doesn't get flooded. That is why it is down $1 today.",oolt3i
Always good to buy and hold AAPL.,oolt3i
You buy and hold and buy and hold and buy on the dip and hold,oolt3i

"If you plan to hold for a very long time, buy whenever. I try to not buy stock at ATH, but I‚Äôm also loaded to the tits in shares already",oolt3i
"Just remember that the stock price is a measure of future expectations. And earnings are about the past. Company could announce a strong quarter, but offer a picture of a bleak future. 

As for whether to buy and sell, only you could answer that question for yourself. You make the decision based on your expectations of your return‚Äîhow much risk you‚Äôre willing to accept and time horizon. 

Good luck.",oolt3i
wise... I think wait for another market correction,oolt3i
I am going to wait a week after earnings,oolt3i
"it ""drops"" mainly because the price of the stock already ran up BEFORE earnings (as people are expecting good news) thus after earnings, not man are interested in the stock anymore thus the volatility falls and price ""drops"" but really it has already risen before that. hope this helps.",oolt3i

Where is the f*cking dip of aapl? I can‚Äôt see it,onswvv
New to this but bought my first 12 apple shares yesterday- do you guys buy regularly like each month or save wait to buy during dips? Was planning to try and get like 1-2 more each month,onswvv
I was in a similar situation.  I went ahead and took profits and left one open that was free on the house money.  For me staring at 120% return in just a few months was to hard to ignore.  No one ever went broke taking profit.  Just my 2 cents.,ombdmf
"You have a lot of time left in those leaps, and my uneducated opinion is that AAPL will continue to trend up between now and then.    You still have July 27 strong earnings coming next week, an undoubtedly great iPhone 13 release in the fall with AAPL setting +20% goals for suppliers. 

Ultimately, you need an exit plan.  That plan includes down and up directions.   

My own plan is buy call options $2-3 in the money, 30-45 days from expiry on the daily dips and usually a $0.50-$1 increase in underlying stock price (of AAPL) will print enough profit that I can't ignore it.   The options provide so much leverage, I don't need a huge swing in price to get where I want to be.   I was day trading +200 $147 AAPL calls 8/13 expiry this week on the dips and selling on as little as $0.25 increase in stock price.   Watch for the crests, sell and then wait for it to drop and repeat.   I do not short AAPL.",ombdmf
"Yeah, I had a few AAPL calls that were up about 100%, decided to take profit on them. Profit is profit!",ombdmf
"I would Hedge the calls if they are naked to a shorter duration like Sept 2021. Use eTrade option income finder to find the best possible option to usr. I typically hedge with an delta  of 0.35-0.5. Then I would use the money to move the buy side from 2022 to 2023 last date possible, when the stock continues the drop. I would keep repeating this process. ....this is a diagonal call. I am 90 percent hedged like this most of the time. If the sell side makes at least a 75% profits because  the stock falls, then I close the hedge and wait. I also use demarks analysis. Currently managing about xxx calls of apple this way and let's say it's very successful. I never short. Don't have brass balls.",ombdmf
Options is just emotions. If you wait until closer to expiration and it moves against you then you're fucked (been there done that).,ombdmf
I got jan 2022 $150s that I bought at the top. Down like 10k already. Contemplating between holding and selling weeklies or selling them all.,ombdmf
Take profit,ombdmf
I would Make it a diagonal and push the buys outüôÑ why on earth someone wd close a 107 is beyond me,ombdmf
I personally am fearing a crash in the coming months bear august so I would sell while I'm satisfied. Especially after earnings when this will most likely fall a bit.,ombdmf
Hold or sell and buy again. There‚Äôs no reason to pay that much premium for a call option if you don‚Äôt plan on keeping it for a while.,olapqd

"Its starting to tail off.  If it breaks 145, its not coming back soon.",olaair
"You fckrs always jinx sht. Just buy and hold stop speculating when it will break walls. AAPL is long game, you don‚Äôt sell it.",olaair
Dip before rip,olaair
"Breaking through resistance points like 150 could be easy and accomplished by natural momentum, or could be done by an earnings beat or some other event. Some of these so-called resistance points are paper walls, others are truly hardened targets, one never knows until we get there.   So far yesterday's minor sell-off ressembles last week's one day dip, and we are already at 149.50 nd could blast through 150 any time now. My sense is we will be 5+ points higher before earnings date and that 160 may be the resistance point, not 150. I see a lot of money now stuck in crappy hot air investments like AMC, cryptos, oil company and re-opening plays which are overvalued.  I also see some undervalued blue chips and potentially hot stocks like T and VIAC, two of the top names in streaming with puny PE's  AAPL has had a  jce run lately b ut remember for a m\]long time it lagged the market and other FAANGS so expect it to outperform.",olaair
"We would probably be over 150 already today if the inflation fear story wasn't the #1story of the day, and that spooks the market a bit so now the risk off trade is on and tech stocks are all down modestly. Plus the Republicans are pushing the inflation fear story now while it is fairly obvious inflation is likely a temporary thing resulting from re-opening after a long shutdown. Of course we might not even be able to fully re-open thanks to anti vaxxer BS, but whether covid shuts us down again or not Apple will benefit. We shall see what happens in the next few weeks including the earnings report. But any price appreciation we don't get before earnings we will likely get after earnings, and yes if AAPl runs up tool fast many will sell the earnings news.  Aso ignore ignorant comments like the one below. 145 is meaningless and if it falls to that price many will be buying.  It is also likely that we will never see the 130's again, so the general direction is up, just not every day.  No stock does up every day.",olaair
"Delta Variant is picking up momentum. Mask mandates are back. Market is spooked. 

Covid numbers will increase over the weekend and Monday will reflect that. Back to 145. Hopefully close the week above 147. 

Covid fears are controlling the market. Conveniently at the start of earnings.",olaair
"150 will break down soon.  It is a natural resistance level as a round number but has little other meaning. AAPL was overdue a run-up after last quarter's staggeringly great earnings but then a ""sell the news"" dropoff instead of a spurt. Now we have gotten a spurt back to where the stock should have been after last earnings report.  But AAPL performance still lags the other FAANGS+M by a lot and has a ways to go to catch up to GOOGL and to MSFT in terms of PE. Next we will get something else, and the odds are that will be an additional spurt as earnings seem to be of a continuous monsterously profitable nature.  So either 150 will fall before earnings or right after. In the meantime 140 is probably the new bottom though it probably won't drop past 145. That is my hunch though I fully aware of that in the battle over the Biden bills the Republicans will keep hyping inflation as a worry, which is a real thing, but likely only temporary and something the Fed warned us about last November as to be expected during the re--opening. That said, since Apple has the strongest supply chain in the world with the most pricing power and now even makes their own chips, they will likely be little affected by inflation.  And if iPhones cost an extra $100 next year it will not be a problem, people will pay it. Also, I do not expect the anti-trust cases will affect them much Apple is not a monopoly (in third place now in total phone sales) and the controls it demands on its own platform are rational and not extraordinary, so at worst they lower ap store commissions by 20%, not a huge deal. They can make up for this in other ways.  In fact my only real worry n ow is for the overall market since so much ""play money"" is being recklessly mis-used in meme stocks, cryptos and other wildly overvalued investments, but again that will likely not affect Apple much. If I were to guess I would say we will be at 165 within 2-6 weeks, but do not expect it to go in a straight line. And so if you want to get into AAPL, days like Friday provide a discount.",olaair

I think a dip is coming, so you could set a limit to sell in case it drops, but keep riding it up, replacing the limit with a higher one each time.

I do think it will go back into the 130's by your expiration, and I don't think it will go much higher",ojiqlo
I have $147 as resistance and again at $155. Seeing that we smashed past the $147 I‚Äôd consider selling a portion of your $145c and maybe hold on to a bit in case it heady to $155 or beyond. Sell 1/2 now. Sell 1/2 of remaining again at $155. Let the rest ride.,ojiqlo

"Not sure if I can trust this article... Apple profit has not relied on Mac sales since the early 2000s, phone sales and services is where they make bread and butter.

On top of that even if Mac sales are slowing down, it would be indicative of the whole market. Everyone needed a new computer to work from home, the market was flooded with chromebook and pc sales which are most likely cooling down as well since everyone that really needed a computer now has one... don't really see the need to replace a computer every year. If that is the case Apple's products, ie MacBooks and iPads are only meant to last a good 3 years before replacing.

I think Apple is in a much better position in the short term future/moving forward than say Dell or HP.

"I'm a buy and hold sort of guy, not a dip in and out. It's really difficult to time the market. If you don't mind getting it wrong on occasion, then bailing when you think it's the highest, and buying in when it's the lowest, is a fine strategy, but honestly, I don't think the locking in of gains is worth the hassle.

If I did this I would have sold a while back and would probably have missed this most recent run up. No way would I have sold when it was at the ATH, since I would have been afraid/hopeful that it was going to go even higher, so I would, at best, have sold on the way down, and probably bought back in before the bottom.

I just prefer adding to my position monthly. I buy in on the 1-6th regardless of price. I think long term it's going to go up. I'm not as bullish as a lot of people on here (i.e. I think $160 is a ways off). But I'm happy when I am wrong and it goes up faster or farther than I expected.

Anyway, if you look at how much profit you'll be locking in, subtract the short term gains tax, then hope for a reentry point, you may find it's worth it for you. I just find this strategy to be too hands on for my tastes.

If you are wanting to do this, I'd think options would be the better way to go.",og8q8m

Think about the taxes! You have not held more than a year. You are more than half way to get better tax treatment if you hold for more than 1 year. At this point I say hold and hopefully $AAPL will be much higher by January 2022 the you can sell locking in bigger profits that will be taxed at a much lower capital gains rate.,og8q8m
Iam holding Apple shares. I bought it at $118 and I don't think it's going to that low again.,og8q8m

"I would just hold since it's only 15 shares. You can average down if you can but I'm sure most people will tell you to just keep buying aapl no matter what. I bought in at 133 and averaged down to 130 at 75 shares now. Like you I was tempted to sell now and jump back in when it dips but it might be risky. I have about 2k ready to throw at aapl but I'm curious if I should wait till it ""dips"" and try to keep averaging down or just buy now.",og8q8m

I would hold .. but more on the dips work my way to 100 shares then get into selling covered calls and collecting some nice premium along the way,og8q8m

It may take another bang-up quarterly report, but inevitably it is going much higher.  An analyst I read who really got into the weeds on AAPL made the point that worst case scenario:  anti trust fines, CHina trade war II, losing to Epic and Spotify etc, none of which is likely the stock is still worth $120. Medium case it shaves its commissions at the Ap store to 25% and keeps executing as before, the stock is worth $155 and if they escape lawsuits, regulation, have hot new products and keep expanding their dominance we are talking $220.

Apple has big growth areas in India, China, Latin America and basically everywhere, and once on IOS they never leave. The anti-trust talk and Epic lawsuit are real concerns, however I seriously doubt congress and Biden will pass and sign anything as it is very difficult to make one rules for every company , and God forbid, if Apple were forced to break up that would unleash even more hidden value. It is possible that all platforms charging 30% to developers might lower their commissions, but Apple is not going to do it unless everyone else does too, and how does the government dictate commission rates?  The last time the government tried to force companies to lower prices was Nixon and his price-freeze gambit was a failure.",nxswiu

WWDC is/will gather a tremendous amount of press attention.

"Well, given the details of the downgrade (below), AAPL held up pretty well today:

New Street downgrades AAPL to Sell from Neutral and sets target price at $90. Analyst Pierre Ferragu commented, ""Most affluent consumers did not see their earnings power much affected by the pandemic, but they saw their spending opportunities shrink. High-end consumer electronics benefited as a result. The iPhone is the best illustration of this, driving close to record shipments in FY21, implying the iPhone 12 is the second best-ever received iPhone, after the iPhone 6. The key question is how things shape up for next year, as the current super-cycle has brought forward demand, the next iPhone line up is likely a ""12S"" type with limited innovation, and consumers spend less on consumer electronics as the economy re-opens. In the piece we publish today, we leverage our unique modeling of iPhone cycles to determine what a weaker cycle would imply in terms of shipments, how this compares to what consensus forecasts, and how the stock could react if our fears reveal themselves justified. We see material downside risk -- shipments in the 180-200m range vs. consensus at 234m, and downgrade the stock to sell, with a $90 TP (28% downside).""",nn1ont
Just look at Apple after the 2014 split. It‚Äôs behaving almost exactly the same. We will be lucky to get 10% this year most likely it seems.,nn1ont
I might be in the minority but AAPL trading sideways/down has been good for me because it keeps giving me opportunities to buy more over time while averaging down! I know we got a bunch of big dicks in here with thousands of shares but I have been growing a share or two at a time. I have just under 50 shares now and am zero worried because I believe in the future of AAPL. If it is sideways or down next week I will be able to get 10 more!,nmhuyf
"All that have money invested hope for a break to the upside. Who would‚Äôve think after a blowout quarter we‚Äôd be trading sideways to down now. I don‚Äôt buy into conspiracy theories but most of big tech that reported strong earnings sold off. The tech market is not rational and very illogical when it comes to aapl. If you‚Äôre trading options, specifically calls I‚Äôd consider going out a year for expiration. And if you get a pop to the upside and you‚Äôre happy with the profit take the money and run!",nmhuyf
"You know. Most of the profit I have seen with my MSFT position happened over the course of 5 days / 365.  The same goes for AAPL. Shut your fuckin trap and hold the stock. Or sell it if you think its overvalued. But there will be some news on AAPL. Some fabulous news. And its gonna bump this stock price up a lot. So if you happen to be holding - congrats. 

Honestly getting tired of these same posts week in and week out from you bitches",nmhuyf

"interesting points from the perspective of Apple leading us toward a cashless society.  Of course, in general, it has been discussed ad nauseam, but with Apple's ""leadership"" the possibility of actually going near cashless becomes more possible and makes the iPhone an even more necessary ""appliance"".

I would personally prefer Apple stay away from crypto.",nmcqww

"Hit the news at 10:40 AM EDT on 5/26/2021
Not much reaction
Apple (AAPL) has an average rating of Outperform and price targets ranging from $115 to $185, according to analysts polled by Capital IQ.",nmb4op
"Morgan Stanley - 4/29/2021

Apple's Revenue Growth 'Sustainable' on Portfolio Strength, Backlog Increase.	

Apple's (AAPL) solid performance across its product portfolio and in every global region in fiscal Q2 points to ""sustainable"" rapid revenue growth for the tech giant, with growing iPad and Mac backlogs likely to extend its sales gains into 2022, Morgan Stanley said in a note Thursday.

Revenue for the quarter was a record $89.6 billion versus consensus of $77.3 billion. EPS also came in above consensus at $1.40 versus $0.99. The analysts attributed the beat to growth driven by the Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions. Morgan Stanley expects the Street's consensus estimate of $69 billion for Apple's fiscal Q3 revenue to rise by $2 billion to $5 billion following the report.

Developing markets such as India, Turkey, Russia, Vietnam and the Philippines provided additonal sales momentum amid wider adoption of financing options pfor iPhone models, driving average selling prices and margins higher, the analysts said.

""Lower inventory buffer limits near-term upside but translates to stronger for longer growth,"" the analysts said. ""... [E]xpanding lead times and a growing iPad/Mac backlog will actually extend Apple's strong revenue performance into FY22, where we have Apple recouping the lost revenue from the June 2020 quarter as supply catches up to demand.""

Morgan Stanley increased its price target on Apple's stock to $161 from $158, maintaining an overweight rating.",nmb4op
"Yes, I expect AAPl will go north of $150 sometime later this year. It has been trading sideways for a month now building a base and 125 seems to be the new bottom. Since it once hit 145 even before its last blowout earnings report, 150+ is realistic.   I personally will be holding until at least 150.  Many experts say it could go north of $180 within a year so again $150-160 is not unrealistic. It is also a safe stock and is therefore rightfully used by many as a place to park their money for capital preservation.  You can also buy SWKS which tracks with AAPl  but usually outperforms it when there is an upward move.",nmb4op
"I have no idea, but I'll speculate. We know Apple had a huge 2020 run up. and even though it has been flat for 6+ months, it is still up nearly 50% since May of last year

Here are some possible reasons for big fish selling:

1. Taking profits now while capital gains taxes are at historic low points. Biden admin talking about legislation to raise these.
2. Exiting because they think Apple still hasn't reached floor. Either the fear of rising rates, or they may think that there is a market correction looming, or at least in the tech sector, and are exiting positions with a view to re-enter at some point.
3. Sell to raise cash for other investments they believe have a higher upside, knowing they can always buy back in to apple.

Honestly, I could see it being a combo of 2 or all 3 of these.",njy4ti
Also probably their lawsuit with Epic.  Depending on the outcome it could be an a scalpel or chainsaw taken to the Apple Store profits.  Im guessing thats the main reason.,njy4ti
My opinion has been the longer it drags the more I add to my position because it's going to explode at some point and go on another crazy run.,njpns1
"Pretty likely, AAPL is overdue for another big run.  The sell-off after their record-setting shockingly awesome earnings report was ridiculous. Since then we have been stuck in the mid 120's but eventually the stock should be worth over $180.   The Epic trial is a bit of a speed bump, but the net effect of it may turn out to be nothing.  Experts mostly agree Apple will win the case and once they do, that will be a catalyst for the stock to pop higher. Worse case, Apple reduces its commissions a little, but I do not see how a judge has the legal authority to force a company to lower its prices unless there was something criminal going on, and in that case Epic would have to prove they and the consumer have been ripped off. I see Epic is making about 700 million a year and paying Apple 100 million (until they stopped paying). nd that seems very fair to me as Apple supplies with them with a billion potential customers and manages everything safely and securely for them.",njpns1
"Ô£ø will start its run soon. Get on the train, boys!",njpns1
AAPL too big to fail if it drops 105 I‚Äôm going all in aapl,ni8zca
Epics case is like a vendor from Costco trying to sell its products down the street and then complaining when Costco doesn't want to place it on the shelf anymore.  If it dips just buy more.,ni8zca
"No i dont think so. They have some very valid arguments. Epic CEO is playing on a bluff and has played a major gamble. And 105? Its just 50 bill in revenue. It wont cause an almost 20% drop. However, if it goes to 105, i am buying with both hands",ni8zca
"The judge cannot do that unless Epic can prove a monopoly, plus that the fees Apple charges hurt consumers. After all it is perfectly legal to charge tolls for use of your property, no one is forcing anyone onto the Ap store and IOS is a platform which apple built and therefore is Apple's property.   Google, Microsoft, Facebook all do the same and Amazon charges a 15% commission to third party sellers plus is tyrannical in how they can throw off any seller they want with no recourse and for no just cause.  Amazon, Facebook and Google are also more monopolies than Apple is.   -- If you sell an Ap on Apple IOS you get a billion paying customers to profit from and that is worth a lot.  Also, since Netflix was able to do great after opting out of the Ap store, that proves it can be done. In fact Epic is profiting now without the Aps store.  So just because the judge asks Tim Cook tough questions doesn't mean she can make up new laws. And if the judge were to rule against Apple she'd also have to rule against all the other platforms, and all the mega cap techs would collapse throwing the entire internet into chaos.  So though she is tough, she is also smart and cannot make up new laws, so expect Apple to win, though perhaps suffer some bad PR in the process.  On the other hand Apple could agree to maybe lower commissions to 25% and be done with it just to please this judge. And if this judge rules in Apple's favor this also protects Apple from any similar lawsuits including Spotify in Europe. Plus then Apple could force Epic to pay 100 million in damages.",ni8zca
"Just listening to an expert on CNBC and he is right. The worst thing that could happen to Apple, though it is unlikely, is that Apple will be forced to slightly lower their commissions, and that Google, Microsoft and others then will have to do the same thing. Who goes first? But it may not be legal for a judge to dictate profit margins.  PLus since everyone else charges 30%, why pick on Apple?  Epic i also not the right plaintiff and was never damaged by Apple. Epic benefitted net-net from Apple.  Also, it is not a monopoly since Netflix was able to opt out and still be extremely successful.  Now Jim Cramer is weighing in nd saying Apple is justified. Developers and businesses can either make 70% of a much larger pot or 88% of a much smaller pot. Some like Netflix can even pour millions into promoting their own website and do it themselves, but only the biggest companies could opt out of Apple's system and still succeed.  Btw this also shines a light on Amazon on their rather high 15% commissions for 3rd party sellers. Well, I sold on amazon for ten years and made . million bucks, paying Amazon about $1,000,000. So I netted 3 million.  Once during a suspension I tried selling the same products on smaller websites. Guess how much I made in one month?  About $500. Not even enough to survive. So paying these commissions to big platforms with a billion customers is worth it.  In fact, it is a bargain.  yes Apple is getting some  bad PR due to epic, but Epic is going to lose and then Apple will counter-sue for 100 million in unpaid commissions.",ni8zca

"I‚Äôve been in Aapl since $0.50. Love these dips!   Always explodes shortly after.   Then splits every few years. Last time it had a split, 7:1 I believe, shares dropped 30 bucks down to $80. Stayed there for months. Then exploded to 500!  For the next split. This is the nature of Apple.  IT IS NOT!!!  A short term play., Like Sndl, Gme Or Hllpf. It‚Äôs a longer term Investment that is stable. With products that corner world markets...always advancing in to the latest technologies, everyone neeeeeds to have.  It has replaced IBM, GE, P&G, XOM & BA as the go-to-stock.  And will certainly play a role in stabilizing portfolios during this Cryto rout! As a safer haven.  But most important of all, it‚Äôs dividend is attractive enough to beat bonds, treasuries, CD‚Äôs , etc...while share price will certainly go up in the interim.  WHY.  Buffet likes Apple. And as to Cathy Woods selling her shares. It‚Äôs not that she hates the stock. But her other plays are tanking so badly, she needs to prop them up off the profits of Aapl. I did the same for awhile.

"AAPL at these prices is a very safe bargain.  Even if we have a recession or more inflation AAPL will continue to outperform and eventually get up over $200. You might also want to look at Apple suppliers like SWKS, very overly beaten down now.  Just avoid cryptos. Those are the one investment type which cold literally go down all the way because there is nothing behind cryptos of any value, nothing.

"Yes Gene Munster is THE expert on Apple and a longterm bull. His view is that any stock goes up and down but AAPL is the #1 FAANMG stock and I agree with him  The market may not agree sometimes, but GOOGL and FB already had their runs recently, Netflix has floundered, Microsoft is not moving as well as AAPL now and is the #2 tech company and AMZN might do great but there is more and more competition online plus I don't buy stocks that don't pay dividends, so AMZN, GOOGl and FB have never done it for me. Those three are also most vulnerable to anti trust regulations, despite the Epic trial going on, AAPL is only a near monopoly inside their own eco-system which they created, not otherwise.  I am also encouraged that 95% of US teens use Apple and either have an iPhone or are planning to buy one very soon. That is a phenomenal stat as US teens generally lead world trends. Gene Munster talks about AAPl hitting 180 and still not being overvalued. I agree. Owning IOS and a billion super loyal upscale customers (and growing) means they can make 200 billion in profits per year so that means a 3 trillion valuation is warranted.",nc8lca

"If you are novice investor consider it an expensive lesson. When I was a young newbie I mad $5000 in one day on my first investment and thought it was easy so I kept doing it. A year later I had lost $100,000. So that was my very very expensive lesson.  Now I only invest in premium stocks at low or modest prices, undervalued AAA stocks basically. If you do that and don't buy at or near the top you will always win at least sooner or later.  and how did I lose $100,000?  Buying into a fad which was Y2K stocks back then. Some of them went bankrupt and I lost 100%. You could lose 100% on cryptos for example or any penny stock without real value and a lot of hype. Two years ago I also lot $25,000 fast buying a cannabis stock which was up 75% and which people said was ""still cheap"". It wasn't. I was lucky I didn't lose even more on  that.

"As we can see the recent chaos and turmoil in the market has re-priced tech stocks downward,  but overshot on the downside. The opening this morning was likely the cheapest point and congrats to those who bought into the chaos.  This chaos IMHO is based on three factors: cryptos (which I consider ponzi schemes doomed to collapse but lately overly successful ponzi schemes, the pyramids growing despite no intrinsic value to these fake currencies at all),  Robinhood gambling day traders (mostly young inexperienced herd mentality types who have ganged up and distorted the value of securities), and #3 over optimism about a complete back to normal re-opened economy sending covid damaged stocks soaring beyond their likely value. There was also a Russian hack on our gas pipeline which Putin cashed in on and which sent oil-gas stocks flying when there is actually still a glut of oil in the world.  Put it all together with normal caution and profit-taking, and we got an over-reaction.  AAPL at 125 is a bargain. So is SWKS at 165 and on down the line. And remember, all these imbalances and problems listed above will pass, maybe very soon or even by the end of the day.",n9t5q0
"Epic will not give up the Battle just like that. They went to the Trial only so that they can prolong this and I am sorry to be the bearer of Bad news but this will take long. Epic is not a small company and they can afford to fight it in court as long as it takes for them to prove that Apple was at fault.

"Stimulus = Regressive tax on entire society; places consumer-class in better position for temporary period; Higher consumer spending = more people buy new iPhone. :)

\- Consumers don't buy raw materials and manufactured capital (e.g., microchips, iron ingots, etc.); they buy finished products, like iPhones; so expect a temporary increase in earnings, business, and subscription services.

However, APPL needs to avoid over-expanding and needs to anticipate a recession in the primary economic sector (resource extraction) in industries like mining.

**Economics 101 for Stimulus Effects**

Since inventories of finished products are depleted during a period of stimulus, there will be a wave of shortages going from the end to the beginning of supply chains. Right now, we're about half-way through, with manufactured intermediate goods (like microchips, wood planks, etc) being stressed. This is resulting in delays for finished products, which means we see higher prices until supply catches up.

Next will be the commodity shortage, which will cause price levels to increase for commodities, which will cause the industry's base to widen & more resource extraction to occur until there is oversupply.  Then commodities will be cheap, manufacturers of intermediate goods will have surplus inventories, which they discount for manufacturers of finished goods, and then we'll see prices dip when finished goods (consumer goods) are oversupplied at the new adjusted prices.  


However, since APPL operates on a colossal profit margin with iPhones and other devices, it seems they're going to remain in the black through the entire recession, and will likely be unaffected by rising commodity prices in the future.  Overall, I think AAPL is a strong play.",n93l4v
"THere won't be a 13, it is an unlucky number so they will call it the X or something, and only make certain improvements and perhaps new models like a folding phone.  Regardless Apple will continue on an upward trajectory in terms of revenues profits and dominance, especially with the young generation. 95% of US teens now use Apple phones and devices, a stunning figure. Plus notice the massive 90 billion buyback fund they allotted which signals that Apple sees no better investment than their own stock, which means they consider it still very undervalued. I agree.  When you generate 400-500 billion per year with a 42% profit margin and your market cap is 2.2 trillion, that is clearly undervalued.  The reason AAPL stock has not performed since their blow-out quarter is that the market is infatuated now with different strategies making false assumptions; like that we can fully re-open, that we are past covid, that things will go back to normal, that crypto is a valid investment, that real estate can continue going up and that any stock beaten down by covid will now out-perform true dominators like AAPl and MSFT. This is false. While short-term traders can play around with all kinds of gyrations and fads, over the medium to long term the most solid investment around is still AAPL and a few other undervalued dominators with similar characteristics. So buy and hold AAPL, and you will not lose.  All stocks go up and down but AAPL is a stock with so such intrinsic proven value behind it that it never goes down for long and will continue on an upward trajectory.  Within six months I expect AAPl will have hit new highs and a $180 price is justified.",n7vawu
AAPL is down because market makers know I bought June 135 calls on Monday. Lost 40% of their value on Tuesday. Once they expire worthless on June 18th I'm sure the stock will head up. This one's on me. Sorry everyone.,n5rqvp
"Apple is very opportunistic with their buybacks and are now loaded for bear with around 100 billion available.  Remember such huge buyback pledges stem from the fact that Apple believe its stock is undervalued. My guess is that they believe AAPL is worth 40-50% more   
 Otherwise they'd use the 100 billion for acquisitions,  but apparently they see no better investment around than in their own stock. I have been in AAPl for 20 years and remember numerous times when the market was crashing and/or there was some bearish fear dominating and affecting AAPL. So far all these fears have turned out to be unfounded, like that Trump's China policy would destroy AAPL, for instance, when it turned out to help them and now sales growth in China is booming  Anyway I noticed several times that Apple itself must have been buying huge amounts as the stock sprang back quickly from low points.  This last earnings report was super and the stock shojld have gone to 150 but the market sold it off instead. What that tells me is that the sell-off has nothing to do with AAPl but a decision by many to rotate their money into post covid stocks or stupid risky cryptos, which is actually quite risky since we really don't know if things will ever return to normal and cryptos could collapse any time. Now shopping mall stocks and raw materials are rallying, yesterday it was oil, but I wouldn't touch either sector with a ten foot pole.  Not if I can buy AapL AT A DISCOUNT.  128 now is a good buy opportunity and though it may go lower, the lower it goes the more Apple itself is likely to be buying. -- Also on the Epic and Spotify lawsuits, they are both shakedown attempts attempted by very successful companies (and the EU) which now say Apple is a bully and needs to be punished.  But unless there are settlements, Apple will fight on for years against these suits, and so far they have been winning almost all these type court battles. So at the end of the day do not expect anything more than a short-medium term slight overhang from these issues. Maybe AAPl will reduce their commissions to 25% for instance, but Apple really does bring these apps developers great wealth and if they had to do it on their own they'd still be small companies. I sold on Amazon for ten years and it the same there, without Amazon's massive global customer base I would have made 85% less than I made. So I gladly paid their commission even though Amazon too are bullies and vendors all hate and fear Amazon. Google, Microsoft and Facebook all do similar things. When it comes to getting paid for clicks on those platforms they probably take much more than 30% of the ad revenue the content generates. Also, for those who say we should force a break-up of Apple, I say bring it on, because if Apple split into four companies that would unlock tremendous value.  But Apple is not a monopoly except within their own eco system, and nobody forces anyone to use IOS or buy Apple products.",n5rqvp
"If AAPL touches 125 it won't be because it was TA that said it must be so. Retracements happen, but there is absolutely nothing in voodoo TA analysis, especially in this market, that requires a stock to touch any price to resume either direction. TA also says that after dropping nearly 5% it's oversold. Does this mean it's going back up? Who knows.",n5rqvp
"Two other oversold bargains right now are VIAC and SWKS.  Both had great earnings but both stocks sold off, same as AAPL.  Buy any of those three now and you cannot lose as they are all at least 30% undervalued.",n5rqvp
"These things just occasionally happen.  Enough people were selling at the open to edge it down.  Then there were people who were on the fence but when they saw it going downwards, decided to cash in their chips too - leading to further decline.  Which then leads to further decline.  Few people like buying when stocks are going down because they fear they could go down even further.

People will come up with reasons but those are just speculative guesses.  When you try to apply them going forward (which is really the goal behind trying to explain a single day market move), they are usually poorly predictive.  

In my experience, the market occasionally just has these ‚Äútics‚Äù that aren‚Äôt really explainable.  At least not in a provable manner.  Trying to explain them is like trying to explain why you occasionally get a summer like day in the middle of winter.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it happens.

Want to make yourself feel better? Take a look at any of the indexes and increase your time line to 5 years or even longer.  Is today‚Äôs drop significantly different from any other drop in the long run?  Do you think that all those other drops had good explanations?  And most importantly, did it affect where we eventually ended up in the long run?",n4vg9m
"I don't know exactly but here are things I've heard so I'll summarize them (poorly).

1. The threat of rising interest rates decreasing the ""real"" future projected earnings.
2. Apple already having an epic run up and being treated like ""cash"" by the big funds who will liquidate shares to pay for other stuff.
3. Just simple profit taking.
4. Manipulation of the big guys to depress the price, capture premiums from options, shake out retail (and then  buy back in at a lower price).
5. Some concern we are in a big market bubble and it is on the cusp of popping sending us into a rather large correction
6.  Tax hikes looming

"AAPL is down because the  **Epic Games, Inc. v. Apple Inc.** Sherman Anti-Trust (anti-monopoly) trial is starting this week. It is expected to last 3 weeks. In its complaint, Epic alleges AAPL has a monopoly in violation of ¬ß 2 of the act with regard to its In-App-Purchases (""IAPs""). Currently, AAPL requires all payment to be made through IAPs and developers are prohibited by the Terms of Service from using indirect/outside payment systems like Stripe, Paypal, Square, etc.  Further, AAPL's IAP fee is 30% of all revenues.

Epic Games owns, runs, and develops Fortnite. Fortnite was using the IAP system until their CEO decided to challenge AAPL's stronghold and he intentionally developed an indirect payment method that violated AAPL's Terms of Service to get around the 30% fee. In response, AAPL removed Epic's products from the Apple APP store, cutting off over 1 billion devices that can access Fortnite. For frame of reference, indirect providers' fees are around 2% (see [Stripe.com](https://Stripe.com)).  That said, if Epic is successful, AAPL could lose $20bn/year in revenue because of the loss of income from IAPs. Further, other players like Google would possibly also be subjected to anti-trust suits. The case also deals with other aspects, like whether the AAPL store has to allow developers to create and publish their own stores, or whether AAPL is permitted to disallow other sub-stores in its store (confusing).

However, if AAPL is successful, it will solidify its position as a global development God. This lawsuit is going to be very interesting.

**For Reference**: AAPL CEO Tim Cook is expected to testify, along with Epic's CEO and a bunch of privacy & software developers. Cook's own statements in the past blatantly say the AAPL App Store was created to prevent competition and hinder work-arounds.

**Case No.:**  4:20-CV-05640  
**Magistrate Judge:** Thomas S. Hixon  
**Statute:** 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1

"Hey guys, so Aapl might be diving a whole lot more in the next 3 weeks.  Reminder that Epic Games is suing AAPL under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, alleging that Apple's In App Purchases (""IAPs"") constitute a coercive & monopolistic effect on the firm's app store.

Currently, Apple takes 30% of all IAPs from all apps hosted on its dev store.  Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite, intentionally breached its contract/agreement with Apple in an effort to circumvent APPL's 30% ""tariff"" on its apps.  In response, APPL pulled Fortnite from Apple's app store, and as a counter-response, Epic Sued under ¬ß 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.

If Apple wins, it establishes a foothold (subject to appeal and certiorari review by SCOTUS) that gives it a dominant presence in the software industry and on its devices for a foreseeable future.  If it loses, Apple may lose its ability to enforce an IAP-only system, which would give other companies like Stripe, Paypal, and Square an entrance point into a colossal industry.

Apple stands to gain $30\~/share if it wins over 6 months, and stands to lose $25-$30/share if it loses in the short run (3-5 months).  This is going to be a wild ride. Note, I have around 150-ish shares ($20k\~) in Apple and I'm betting on a strong rebound regardless of the outcome over a 12 month period. Sitting on an additional $20k to invest after trial.

This could literally blow companies like Square, Paypal, and Stripe into the stratosphere by bypassing IAPs and going to direct purchasing. This will be a game changer. Apple currently charges developers 30% of all revenues.

"First of all, I am deep in this stock and believe it will grow like crazy, but my personal counter argument as tech guy is that Apple is stuck with it‚Äôs products. They know their customer base is super loyal to them so they don‚Äôt try as hard as they used to. For example, it‚Äôs 2021 and the refresh rate on their most expensive iPhone is still 60hz. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years and every major company has gone out of their way to create amazing vibrant 90-120-144 hz displays with higher and clearer resolution. What did Apple do?

"The problem with a company like Apple is that they make so much money that the bar is set incredibly high. The share price reflects this idea that Apple will consistently print tons of money.

"Let‚Äôs take it back to 2014. My wife left her job and I rolled her $60,000 401k into an IRA. APPLE and NETFLIX both split. I bought 30k apple at 100 a share, 300 shares and 30k Netflix at $88 a share. Quickly they both went up at first and I thought I was a god. Then Apple started dipping. Analysts were bashing it saying it‚Äôs too big. It can‚Äôt hit 1 trillion. It‚Äôs too much. My friends and family thought I was nuts. I watched it go from 100 to mid 60‚Äôs. Every paycheck I‚Äôd buy one or two shares. Bonuses I would buy 5 here 5 there w tax returns. Finally something in the air changed and it started to move. Throughout the time there were a few dips of 10 to 20% but I just held on. TL;Dr 6 years later it went from $100 to 535, split 4 to 1 September 2020. I now had 400 shares that turned into 1600 overnight. My $30,000 was now $214,000. Netflix I‚Äôve never touched either but didn‚Äôt add any extra and my $30k is now $188,000. So long story short. Just buy it and hold it. Don‚Äôt overthink it. When they market lies and says there‚Äôs a tech sell off, buy more. When they say it‚Äôs 2 trillion and too big just buy more. Add a share here or there when you can when it‚Äôs red. There will be corrections and fake market manipulation done to try to get you to sell it. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Just hold on. Once they enter the VR/AR space it‚Äôs game over.",mn7wym

"AAPL was $60 per share a year ago (post-split) so that is 100% return in one year. Investors are taking profits and buying reopening stocks like banks, hotels, airlines, industrials which are poised to grow this year. AAPL is also currently on a downtrend below the 20 and 50 day moving averages. There is some news that Apple is buying back shares which may be why there is strong support at $119. Otherwise, I‚Äôm expecting AAPL to go down and consolidate some more ($110?) and then hopefully skyrocket again later this year. For now, I‚Äôm buying the dips and selling covered calls.

This reminds me so much of 2014 to 15 after the split. It went from 100 to 120 then down to 70‚Äôs. Market bashing them for being close to a trillion. Hate from analysts for being so far ahead market cap from everyone else. I just kept my head down and kept buying. Everyone mentioning split adjusted price. Then about a year later it was like they took the training wheels off and let it go. And go it did. I have no fear it‚Äôll happen again. Might take Facebook or someone else to hit a trillion first. That should help.,m7yvlw

It‚Äôs getting really fucking old. News today...‚Äùapple makes faster iPad‚Äù down 3%. Amazon now sells kids clothes than anyone...down 3%. Some company I‚Äôve never heard of upstart up 100%.,m7u3hh

"Right now, I still treated as the safest investment. You can buy in the 117 to 121 range and if you want to sell it at 1:26 to 127. The thing is, even if it goes down long-term you‚Äôre never going to lose your money. And then you can keep averaging down. If you‚Äôre looking to day trade You can probably do better but if you want to make a safe smart returns you could do a trade this or go long you can‚Äôt lose",m7u3hh
"AAPL is one of those stocks that tests your patience for months and then rewards you. This is one of the only stocks you can buy and hold and sleep comfortably knowing that you'll earn 30-40% annually if not more over a 10 yr period. Can't even say the same for MSFT. 

Couple things AAPL has going for it that makes it a great long term hold - M chips, AR, focus on health and fitness, apple pay & card, Apple glasses, 6G, their research into satellite tech, TV+ is just getting started (they actually have good shows contrary to popular belief). Anything related to the potential Apple Car is gravy on the top. 

Plus they invest a lot in R&D....

HODL!",m7u3hh
RSI down fairly low. Due for an uptrend.,m7u3hh
"Algos selling because of bond rates?  Or bigger funds and investors treating like cash and selling to cover other things for a while?  Or more conspiracy oriented - big fish milking as much premium as they can from retail traders buying short dated calls?

I think there are a lot of factors contributing, but you can only keep it down so long.  If you can hold, and if you can keep buying in, you will be rewarded in the long run I think.

Of course, a bigger market correction can happen if the FED suddenly has to raise rates...but if this keeps dragging along like it is, I'd say a bit of that may be getting priced into the market.

EDIT: I wanted to add that we are still viewing this in a very short time frame. IT has only really traded sideways for about 4-6 months. This could go on longer, or we may be nearing the end of it and might start testing higher lows soon.  I lean toward the latter.  My target is $130 being established as a new support by mid to late April.",m7u3hh

Do you know for a fact it‚Äôs going to continue dropping?  That‚Äôs the problem.  No one knows where the bottom of the dip is and many of us have AAPL for the long game.  That strategy could very well bite you in the ass.,m0u7ku

If sold at profit, that's around 20% in taxes owed. I got called away on covered calls and surrendered shares I've been holding for years through many splits.  Now in the process of rebuilding position.  I'm just following the technicals and putting in limit buy orders.  Who would have thought AAPL would visit $116 yesterday? That was my bet yesterday. Each morning just look for a potential technical low and put in a limit order. If it gets hit, it gets bought. If not, just adjust the next day. For now, just doing 10 shares per trade.

"Rumors are that AAPL will release Apple Watch 7 with above the skin glucose monitoring. That will add at least 20 to 30% to its market value. What we are seeing here is big money rotation into other sectors. Once this noise has subsided, AAPL should be back to the $130s",m0s1tg

"I'd say closer to $90 per share due to the 20% growth it will likely experience this year. Also note the increase in profit margin due to the change to servicing business model. But yes, if the reversion to the mean is in fact happening, I expect AAPL to eventually dip down closer to reality, at some point, and that point may be very far in the future and very brief because tech's overvaluation will likely continue until an actual recession where a 40% drop happens and millennials become disillusioned with tech stock.

I think it's a good lesson for young investor to remember how old investors like Warren Buffet managed to live through countless crises and reversions to the mean: they behaved cautiously during boom time. Buffet has been hoarding a huge amount of cash (Berkshire's cash position is about 1/3rd of its market cap) so he's well-positioned to take advantage of these reversion to the mean.

I am long on AAPL, still profit at $120 but I have to admit that I should have been more patient in buying, no matter how much I love the stock. The simple fact is that, even if all of our wishes and prayers are answered and AAPL continue to climb at 20% revenue growth rate per annum, it would take 2 years for it to be **fairly valued** at $140 again. During those 2 years, I will bet that I can enter AAPL again at a PE closer to its historical, and if I don't, there's other companies out there that are better bargain.",lxllch

$300 would make Apple like a 5T company.,ltcru3
"AAPL is a 10T company easily in 8-10 yrs 

1) Chips - their M chips will be world class, 

2) Health - wearables will continue growing and with their foray into health they will have a stickier ecosystem than ever (you already see the beginning with insurance companies having reward programs tied to the Watch). Tim Cook has already said that AAPL will be remembered for it's contribution to Health. 

3) Wireless - they've been looking into satellite technology for the past few years - I think we will get to a point where you won't need sim card - aapl will provide wireless services. They're already looking into 6G

4) Auto - they're doing work here and while they may be behind TSLA, their investment in Didi Chuxing will pay off and a potential revenue stream will open

5) AR/VR - we haven't seen the use cases yet but they've embedded this stuff in their iPad and soon it'll be in their phones. They've made good progress with their Glasses too which should be unveiled within 12 months. 

6) Fintech/Techfin - Apple pay, apple card - lot of folks overlooked apple pay when first announced, but look at it now and they're not even close to world wide adoption. Wait till their Apple Card starts to gain traction (I can assure, it's the banking oligopoly in most countries that are trying to slow them down and not AAPL taking it's own sweet time). 

The above is only what we know about. It's one of the most secretive companies so who knows what else they're working on.

"Serious question - why did it double from a year ago (pre-crash) and triple from two years ago?  I know lots of other companies did too, but we all know that and admit they are overvalued (looking at Tesla). Or they were unknown and relatively small and had a huge momentum going for them. Or it is Amazon where all of a sudden everyone is using their service all the time because stores are closed and/or everyone is staying home. 

Why did Apple increase so much?  I keep watching it and thinking of buying in but I feel like there is disconnect.

You can see the same thing happened to Nvidia an Microsoft despite the fact they also had good reports   Add in some macros like the bond stuff and a little panic selling and to have a retrace with no bad news.

"Rule #1 of Apple: Unless the company has announced the product, it almost certainly does not exist. For almost 20 years, Apple has used the idea of an ""Apple car"" as a sort of ""trap project"" for new management hires to see if they can be trusted. In other words, until Apple announces a car, presume any claims of one coming down the proverbial pike are wrong because they almost certainly are.

That said, I would not invest in Tesla because they have insignificant cash flow. While people might really like their Teslas, it doesn't change the fact the cash in has not exceeded cash out often enough, long enough, nor at a growth rate fast enough to just its current price. To justify buying Tesla's share I think you would either have to think they are going to double their profits for every year for the next few years, if not decades, or the price would have to implode more than GameStop's did recently.",lrrhf7

You think AAPL doesn't track what you do on iOS, on Safari, on their watch, on Apple Music, and more? This move doesn't just cripple FB and GOOG, it also affects developers and third parties like Unity Software and others. They're shamelessly doing so under a benevolent narrative that their loyal fanbase - like op - happily eat up, providing them with free marketing. 

I recommend doing some more research on how this move affects smaller businesses that depend on these ads, as well as how it affects companies other than FB and GOOG, and how it further positions AAPL as a bigger tech bully, no better than FB or GOOG.",lpgbfc

So I'll come back at the discount. People who have been holding long have nothing to worry about, I just don't want to be waiting on a peak.

People sold because they heard Warren Buffett sold shares.  What nobody cares to do is their DD.  He had 48% of his portfolio as AAPL, and now STILL has 43% of his portfolio as AAPL.  He shaved a tiny snippet off the top of the top (see image pie graph link above of his portfolio).  What he sold was what he basically profited in a month off AAPL. Psh.  If he thought it was not good, he would have done WAY more than that little tiny bit.  It allowed him to be more diverse and enter into things he saw as buy opportunity, not that Apple would lose money.  Way over reactions about nothing.",lnfliy
"Keep in mind, since the bottom of Covid in March 2020, Warren Buffett's portfolio is only 53% more now.  1 year from today it was only a 5.93% profit.  Well AAPL alone is up 60.52% 1 year from today and 120% from the bottom in March... So Guess what that means?  ALL his non AAPL other stuff lost at least 50% since 365 days ago, and lost 67% since the bottom.  Of COURSE HE IS NOT GOING TO SELL A TON OF THE COMPANY THAT DUG HIM OUT OF A MASSIVE HOLE!!!!!",lnfliy

"To me it‚Äôs a wait and see, after the proxy vote on the 23rd of this month. And the information recently surfacing about Warren Buffet selling his shares in Apple.  Which of course every article on such, is misleading. No one did their research, as to WHY Buffet is selling some of his stake.  Anyone who fully comprehends Share-Buy-Backs knows, some one needs to be willing to sell their shares back. And most hedgies, institutional Managements, and individuals do not wish to, knowing Apple share price will rocket once Share-Buy-Backs kick in. Buffet  has graciously sold some of his stake back to Apple this last year.  Knowing all too well, his remaining stake will gain substantially once his sells go through. Buffet‚Äòs Berkshire funds have massively prospered from both the sells to Apple‚Äôs Share-Buy-Back, and to the remaining shares growth as a result. Too. Buffet loooong ago worked out a divi with Cooke for buying up Icahn‚Äòs stake in the company.  A divi that is better than the rest of us.  But we prosper greater on share price increases anyways. The divi is just dinner every night.  

Apple smashed on earnings. And will do so again next quarter.  Then come Spring we will see a divi increase.  And summer brings school start up buys for smart devices. Apple isn‚Äôt going away.  Any smart person doesn‚Äôt trade Apple for the short position. Wise folks buy for the longer position.  If you are trying to make a quickie buck inside of a week...Apple isn‚Äôt for you. But if you have patience, you could make out like we did all last year....during an occupational disaster business buzzkill for most-pandemic.  Then bathe in the treasure Capt. Cooke brings back from his High Seas plunders, of other electronic startups. ...",lmd0m8

"I mean, I'm in $AAPL all day every day, brah!",lcw1uo
AAPL will disrupt the car industry as we know it. There were palm pres and blackberries before iPhone came out. iPhone decimated everyone of them and other companies emulated AAPL. look where it is now. With the car aapl is headed back to the $500 or more range.,lcw1uo
"I think you're being optimistic. I expect a climb, but a steady one, I doubt we'll see much above $145 (and sticking) any time soon.",lcw1uo
Bought more today.,lcw1uo

 Apologies but I see it lower,lc57x1

Best stock ever,lc2e17
"I was wondering the same thing.  There's no rational reason for it to go down, but then again this is the market rational isn't something they do almost everything trades on speculation.",lbq0x2
It‚Äôs a pattern that exists for years. The stock will be on a bearish mode for some time. And it will test a heavier pull down until the 200 DAverage settles above 117-125. Won‚Äôt be surprised to the AAPL below 120 üò¨. (Long since 1996 with 100% of my investments in Aapl),lbq0x2
I just don‚Äôt get it. I thought buying pressure would increase as we got toward the Ex dividend  date. I thought we would see 140 by Friday tbh. I‚Äôm holding 2/26 139C‚Äôs and am bleeding hard. I‚Äôm hoping we see a reversal next week but who knows.,lbq0x2
AAPL running high. Buy now,lbq0x2
AAPL deserves to be in the 200s range with what the company actually is!,lbmxe9
I love AAPL!,lbmxe9
Long term stock,lbmxe9
Buy buy buy Aapl.,lbmxe9
I‚Äôm holding AAPL forever,l9iknl
"Interesting thought well, there‚Äôs nothing wrong in taking some pie off the table. Diversification is always good. But diversifying away from Apple by cutting down shares may not be the best play here, especially considering that you have been holding for ~12 years!",l9iknl
"Unless you had a compelling reason to believe that an alternative assets ROI would substantially outperform (by at least the Capital gains tax + yearly apple return) one of the leading stocks in the market with an equivalent risk profile, dividend and buyback program, then it dosnt sound like a good idea.",l9iknl
Agreed. It just doesn‚Äôt feel right for this stock in particular. Thanks.,l9iknl
Holding as well.  Got in after falling in love with my ipod.,l9iknl
Was in before another 2:1 split back then.,l9iknl
I have and still holding it,l9iknl
"It's headed 200 plus deal with Kia and Hundia motors,   both to  build ev, is the play.  They are not going to back off from their new big play.  They are a progressive  conglomerate",l9bftz
Too early to talk about bearmarket just had a few red days ffs,l9bftz
It‚Äôs a $3T company,l9bftz
"We need to work as one to make literal history. The suits want us diluted and discouraged. Share this site around it will help us stay on the same page for buying and holding

Buying $140c 3/19. Still Bullish. FOMO will kick in when things calm down and this thing should reflect its earnings report. GMAFB that this is sitting at $131.00. This is like owning AMZN  or TSLA at HUGE discounts IMHO,l9bftz
"History has shone.  That after Apple earnings, there is ALWAYS a drop. This week, it became exacerbated by shorts covering their losses, by selling their shares in FAATANG stocks...two big dogs of which, were Apple and Tesla.   But if you look at all the analysts out there except Goldman Sachs who usually gets things wrong. Apple is a strong to normal buy. They smashed earnings. And will do it again next quarter too. Back orders on new iPhones now, are til March. And btw. No One sells a divi stock, until their dividend is PAID!!  Which I believe the cut off date is now February 6th

I said last year at this time, Apple was going to $500 by Xmas. After Goldman Sachs put a sell on it.  I was wrong. It hit $500 by August. Four months early. In a pandemic! [pre-split price]  I have been telling all my followers these last four weeks, Apple would hit 150 after Xmas. 175 after earnings. And we could see 240 by the end of Spring. What drives the price hike, is multi-faceted. For one, most products are made in China, who did the responsible thing and shut down their economy early. Which then gave them the world power, to manufacture while all other nations fumbled the pandemic. Hence why, we are seeing iPhones, iPads, iwatches at all.  In addition, Services. Which saw a pandemic boost, to an already growing market share. Then there is the Share Buyback program. Apple has the largest, and has been very successful at using it.   Let‚Äôs not forget too, the Trump Tax Bump. Which will go away I‚Äôm sure shortly. But not for another quarter or two, as laws take time to wheedle thru the system.   And lastly. Something every one always forgets...except long time investors.  Exchange Rate. Which at present is in Apple‚Äôs favor. Trump tanked the dollar against all other currencies... in his trade wars.  So anything that sells outside the U.S., brings in waaaaay more dollars to the U.S.  booming profits artificially.  Btw. I never buy and sell Apple repeatedly. I‚Äôve been a holder since ‚Äò86. It‚Äôs been a cash cow since ICahn dove in and then bailed. Leaving it to Buffet to shove shares higher.  Why does Buffet do it?  For the dividend.

Good Luck.  But I wouldn‚Äôt sell.",l90jzc
Long AAPL.  Hold your calls.  Big $ dumping (w tears) to cover shorts.  145 by next Fri.  AAPL history...stonk goes up pre earnings...then goes down a minute...then shows peeps how biz is done.  Minus a big black swan u good.  Hold.,l90jzc
"I think all this GME/AMC/Robinhood novel have taken out some liquidity from market and in that regard prices of a range of stocks have been reduced. However, at some point there must be a pullback. I would like to tell you that all of this is going to happen before Friday but this problem may last some additionally days.",l90jzc
Hold if you like money.,l90jzc
Apple is stronger than ever,l90jzc
"This next week should be positive.   I am planning on buy calls tomorrow and buying to close my covered call positions.  Friday is dividend pay out for all stock holders.  If you look at the charts going back to 2017 (as far as I went) there is a bit of a run up to that day, then a sell off...not 100% but close enough.  I  can't say how high it will go....140 might be a reach.  GL!",l90jzc
"I have a huge position on Aapl also.  But sold 85% last Friday.  Since I am swing trader I can always buy more on more weakness.  If it goes up i still make some,  scaling is important.  Aapl is most valuable company in the world.  Its not like your are holding GME. Hold fearless on your shares. Options always risk of expiration",l90jzc
I would suggest to hold if you still have extra cash on account.,l90jzc
"I bought 100 into the dip. Market situation by end of last week was overall bearish and aapl, despite all great figures presented and the very promising future pipeline took much too worse of a hit.

Could be however, that the sell-off by HF continuous, which could have been a major driver for the above average drawdown. But even then, it is just a matter of one more week before a turnaround should occur.",l8fkqu
I went balls deep on puts after my calls got crushed lmao,l8fkqu
"I‚Äôm in long and holding, been here before and they bounce back at some point.",l8fkqu
stay strong with AAPL. Buy more if it goes lower. Maybe a long call at 120 strike. You will double your money in less than a year or maybe more.,l8fkqu
I think it will go down 128 and then bounce back up,l8fkqu
"I‚Äôm in 269 shares (unfortunately at their ATH) ... but I believe in America, Apple and the world so I am long bullish on this $2T company",l8fkqu
will move to bullish this week not that most took profits. But what do I know. Apple to the üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,l8fkqu
Is apple getting shorted,l8fkqu
Bought at 144 and crying.,l8fkqu
Bought $120K on AAPL 22/1/21 180 Call last week. I believe the dip caused by market chaos is a very sound chance.,l8fkqu
large investment funds and retailers are very attentive to enter is just what they were waiting for a correction.,l8fkqu
Do you think this will go to 200 by year end?,l8fkqu
Have 47 calls it should shoot up soon with those huge earnings they had,l8fkqu
"The more relevant ? is: where will you/stock be in five years.
You may be dead, but the company/stock certainly won‚Äôt be üòù",l7wj2t
Lol no,l7wj2t
Just added 11 shares at 132. Now own 100 shares of AAPL. The Hedgefunds are giving us their shares. That‚Äôs sweet. Thank you,l7vj25
You need to be patient with Apple. Hold the stock or LEAPS. This thing will blast past 150 soon,l7vj25
"AAPL prices may fluctuate a bit. But buy and hold, don‚Äôt even think twice of buying. It‚Äôs the best run company in the world. Even Buffet agrees that.",l7vj25
I have 300 @126 average. It‚Äôs going to $200 according to the analysts,l7vj25
"Waiting for the Apple car news . Is it too much to ask for info now, the auto industry says they make certain models  5 years in advance if Apple really wants to get into automotive they need to be working on it now.",l7vj25
"I have 200c for feb 26 $150, I trust that AAPL can get back to 137 level next week and then break the handle to move to new highs reflecting this ER results",l7vj25
Just shares here. What‚Äôs going on? Hedge sell off / general market uncertainty?,l7vj25
I bought in at 143.95 last week. I don‚Äôt have much experience so I thought I was buying into the dip. I‚Äôm Im not sure whether to hold now or sell once it gets close to $140 again because it seems like it might not get back up to becoming profitable for me.,l7vj25
I‚Äôm in with $160 Call 3/5. Down 2k right now. Holding because I think it will go up. Bought right before earnings and am very irritated with how it‚Äôs performing üòÇ,l7vj25
Getting ripped,l7vj25
AAPL buy and hold!,l7vj25
I got some calls for 2/17@140 I stupidly held through earnings. How fucked am I?,l7vj25
This should be at 150 with there 4qtr earnings. Blowout #s,l7vj25
"Apparently it always dips after earnings, even good earnings. Still hard to hold, but holding.  Think long term not hourly.",l7vj25
"Apple is solid company based on earnings, cash and outlook.  Strong  buy/hold.",l7vj25
"Let me start, I have 2x $140c exp 3/19, I am holding right now. I was up $1300, now just $300.",l7vj25
I have 141 c 2/5,l7vj25
I think AAPL is much safer then any stocks. GME AMC BB we may loose everything and it may never recover again but with AAPL is always win win for everyone,l7vj25
Someone's at aapl getting nervous. Rushing for something to happen before days end.,l7vj25
$200 ! Here we come!,l79gkq
Maybe it‚Äôs because of everyone focused on GME and amc?,l79gkq
200 $  AAPL   ALL BUY,l79gkq
Blowout earnings best ever should be at 175 just off 4th qtr earnings. This is a money making machine.,l79gkq
Apple usually falls 1-2 days after earnings to make that weeks calls expire worthless. Will rally from Monday!,l79gkq
Is anyone going to answer OPs question? Cause I‚Äôm curious also,l79gkq
"Itll recover next week. We needed monthlies to close out and the retail investor sentiment to cool down. But with dividends next week and a fresh start, this will be back up. I also believe that call options will get bought up by hedge funds at these levels which should give a boost.",l79gkq
"GME short squeeze already impacted the market, but it will be ending very shortly in next coming week. AAPL will back to right track as well.",l79gkq
"It's partly becsuse of GME. Some are selling AAPL to cover their losses, while others are selling AAPL to buy GME and hold, but most of the trades are being suspended.

Let's not forget Suckerberg going to war with Apple because they can't profit as much from FB users' data as compared to last time due to Apple's new App Tracking Transparency feature.

These factors will cause a temporary dip in AAPL share price. There are idiots who sell after earnings. Don't be like them. You hold stocks like Apple. They have huge potential every year. They're rumoured to collab with Hyundai and Huawei to make Apple Car in a few years, of which may be a possible contender of Tesla.",l79gkq
"One possible explanation is that the market conditions favor shift of capital towards riskier growth stocks, many of which are now experiencing crazy returns. I do agree with you that AAPL should have been already @ $150",l79gkq
