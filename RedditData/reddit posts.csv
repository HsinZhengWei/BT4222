"How is Apple mitigating the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which would render TSMC inoperable?","TSMC has begun construction of a $12 billion fabrication plant, but that will not be ready for production until 2024.

TSMC supplies Apple, as well as Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and many others.

I image that the most likely course of action would be for Apple to switch back to Intel (CPUs and GPUs) for its mac lineup, and perhaps Samsung for its iPhone lineup, as these two foundries would be most prepared for such types of processors at large volumes (maybe less so for Intel and its Arc graphics processors).

However, those are just my thoughts (with not too much insight into the whole situation). Does anyone know any sources that discuss, in detail, Apple's contingency plan in the event of an invasion?

Apple’s Record Revenue,"Shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) jumped 2.97% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the technology giant posted positive financial earnings.

Financials: Apple reported earnings of $1.20 per share and revenue of $83 billion; both were better than expected.

The Good: The company’s iPhone revenue totaled $40.67 billion, which was better than expected. Overall, the company posted a June quarter record revenue.

The Bad: Services revenue was $19.6 billion, which was below estimates. And revenue for Mac decreased by $1 billion year-over-year.

Let’s Cook: In an interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were some challenges, including supply constraints and shutdowns in China, but Cook anticipates revenue accelerating and sees no “macroeconomic effect” on iPhone sales.

Final Thoughts: Apple is down 13% this year, which is better than most tech stocks. Despite problems, the company found a way to have a good quarter.

AAPL and High Beta: Downside Reversal and Continuation,"[AAPL Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/c8NBPSxy/) \- Downside Targets for AAPL and High Beta.

NQ-100: https://www.tradingview.com/x/PaXafiQq/

The market complexion has changed greatly from ""there is no chance of a recession"" to ""well, maybe there could be a recession"" as the economic data continues to deteriorate. Continuing Jobless Claims in the United States increased to 1.375M in the week ending June 25 of 2022 from 1.324M in the previous week. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 4K to 235K in the week that ended July 2nd, compared to market expectations of 230K, suggesting labor market conditions could be moderating.

But, I think it is just getting started as many companies are laying off and cancelling employment offers. These activities take time to get into the system and ""The Counting Rule"" is... they must be actively looking in-order to be counted. So, don't hold your breadth. And keep in mind the Fed will remain hiking rates, while the ECB will eventually need to jump on this wagon.

Speaking of the ECB.

The United States is acting as-if The Federal Reserve Raising Interest Rates solves everything. Government Debt in the [United ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSX-UNC/)States increased to 30,499,619 Trillion in May from 30,374,155 Trillion in April of 2022.

The US Debt to GDP increased to 137% from 128%. They act as-if there is nothing for the public to worry about; however, many issues have not begun to trickle into the US, as far as we're concerned.🥶Winter is going to be a huge test for the US and so will the household debt crisis -- not yet discussed in media as companies are trying to figure out how to keep consumers spending (e.g. buy now; pay later).

But, raising rates does not stop the government from spending, nor does it stop the government from issuing more debt. We also have other factors in play such as the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet , [M2](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/m2/) Money Supply, and WH Executive Orders at play here.

HOWEVER.... The point of this post is the ""very tight"" interconnection between the US and UK. Remember it is a global market and just like the global market crash of 1929 we are more connected today than ever before.

👉 The US and UK are at EXTREME levels of government debt and both facing economic collapse scenarios.😳 If the UK goes down - don't think for a minute that the US cannot go along with it. You have seen my recent post about the US Liquidity Swaps, right? If not, scroll down the news feed and you'll see it.

Nevertheless, through my external analysis of the markets (with annotated charts) there remains a very-strong conviction that the recent lows of the financial markets will be tested and broken. This also takes into account the Federal Reserve [Balance Sheet](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fundamental/) and the fact the Government Debt continues to expand against the GDP.

Downside targets for the SPX and NDXNDX = T1 9,538; T2 8,200 (current price is at 12,109.05) SPX T1 3,040; T2 = 2,750 (current price is at 3,902)

I GET IT... Many will not be supportive of the above. I am not here to say, ""see, I told you so"" or anything of that nature - as I'm providing my thesis into all the posts I provide with thorough assessments into the global markets and not based on raw emotions.

I really hope this post (and others) have been informative, helpful, or at least worthy enough for your review. I ""value your time"" and am humbled that you took the time to read, comment, etc. on any of my posts.

Thank you",vw6qop,5,2022-07-11 09:43:03

Good news bad news for long term Apple investors?,According to Loop Capital analyst/guesser John Donovan Apple will save the big upgrade we’ve heard about for Sept 2023 reveal.  I think it makes sense for apple to do this because 2023 is estimated to be a better market then the next 15 months. You don’t release your big guns in a down market when less people will be buying because of recession sticker shock eating up their extra retail dollars. This follows my thesis that apple stock had at least another 20-30% to fall before finding a bottom in this recessionary inflationary market. For those believers patient enough to see if the price drops further (I’ve long called the bottom in two steps; 136 channel and 117 channel. Others have called for a full retreat to the split area of $100.,vs2rkb,6,2022-07-06 01:06:30

$AAPL Prediction for Monday?,,uqpgpk,7,2022-05-16 14:31:54
China lockdown areas showing no new covid cases,"Now, hopefully, China will remove the restrictions.  This is the problem Tim Cook was talking about costing Apple 4-8 billion this quarter.  During the lockdowns Apple plants have been mostly functional inside hermetically sealed factory campuses with dorms, with government assistance, but workers have started losing their minds.   Plus no one in China can go Apple stores until the lockdowns end. 

We have a real massive correction going on now, even without Putin, but almost all the stuffing has been knocked out of the market.  Some weaker former meme stocks may go out of business, but this major stress test is evolutionary.  The weak are weeded out and the strong shall survive and become stronger, and when though AAPL has suffered a 15% drop, that is somewhat merciful and can be easily recouped fast once the stormclouds clear. Looking to the 4th quarter of this year to get back on track. 

Bloomberg experts are now saying that the sentiment about where the bottom will turn out to be has us close to it now, but not quite there.  They said a 20% correction would likely signal a bottom and we are 3-4% away from that now. But of course not alls tocks or sectors are in the same boats here,.

I am no technical expert but 155 now 152 has been holding and if 150 is breached the 145 level should hold.  The huge Apple buybacks also provide foundational support and rocket fuel into rallies.  I know picking bottoms is just luck, but if you pick the right stocks at a peak negative time, you will likely do great in the medium term.

I made an 80% profit on AAPL in six months 2008 buying at the pits of the crash. That is an example. I know many dont have any cash to invest are afraid to go on margin, but there is a tremendous amount of cash on the sidelines now and US blue chip stocks are the safest places to invest, so given all that, Putin permitting (a huge caveat) this is a great time to buy the very best stocks at large discounts",unauxm,12,2022-05-11 22:16:13

"Why I am going all in on AAPL despite knowing there will be a market crash bigger than 2008 and ongoing supply chain issues and tensions in China / Taiwan with Foxconn and TSMC . ( HINT Apple won't be affected, not only that, but will thrive). [ Sources Cited ]","The thing is, Apple has been holding back just for such a scenario. 

How it's been holding back?

First, lets get to what the demographic reach of Apple is. They are skew upper middle class, compared to Walmart or Costco that skews right in the middle. And for those upper middle class, Apple would be classified as a stable rather than discretionary. They are used to Apple ecosystem and will not resort to Android or Windows. They NEED those products for work and school. Many company's official work laptops are Apple laptops. 

Now lets get back to the question, how has Apple been holding back? Any Apple user can tell you why. We all know it. 

The Macbook has USB-C ports but not the iPad or iPhone. 

The iPad and iPhone have strong airtag functionality but Macbook Pro is sorta limited and can't activate an Airtag. 

The Macbook and iPad have headphone jacks but not the iPhone. People would love a thicker iPhone if it meant more battery life, which would also make the headphone jack more possible. 

They could very well make a 200$ iPhone SE without 5G and capture the emerging markets in India, South America, Africa, ME, and China which are Android strong holds. Right now in less wealthy countries the iPhone is a status symbol and people use phones like the Samsung A series. They are going to add BILLIONS to the Apple ecosystem and also retire the 3 year old iPod. The average phone price in those countries are 200$. 

Well, after the crash and people are low on money, they will hesitate to buy new Apple products and might opt out on getting the newest upgrade in lieu of waiting for next years' models. And easy sacrifice to make as Apple products are good to last for 5 years at least or more if you want to push it. So this would cause a PLUMMMIT in their earnings right? 

Wrong

Boom: iPhone and iPads with USB-C

Boom: iPhone with headphone jacks. They're going to say it's because it'll now have high impedance jacks for music creators  https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-with-3-5-mm-headphone-jack-and-advanced-support-for-high-impedance-headphones.2334784/

Boom: 200 dollar iPhone S/E https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxM8NcD3Xvg

Small Boom: Macbooks can activate airtags. 

All these changes will make their current products obsolete except for the Macbook (I'll come back to that in a moment). People will then get an *EXTREME* #**URGE** to buy the new Apple products no matter what the financial stability might be. 

Now you are going to be thinking 'LMAO APPLE WOULD NEVER DO SUCH A THING'. Wouldn't they? Case in point, the new design update for the Macbook Brought back the ports and mag safe. Apple has been holding back on those things for such a time and they anticipated it, so they brought them back this year. It's still holding back some but soon they'll have face ID and Airtag activation. 

Look for similar improvements in their other products lines. 

Apple is going to crush expectations this year and next year while everyone else stock is down 50%-90%.

AAPL valuation trends,"AAPL is my favorite **defensive** stock for growth.  Since 2011 they have grown market share in PC sales (laptops & desktops) from 10.5% to 13+% while maintaining their premium pricing model IN SPITE of Intel and MSFT's Windows 10/Windows 11 efforts.  

(link:) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-share-apple/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-share-apple/)

Yup, iPhones are their biggest moneymaker, but Macs and services (Apple TV, App Store, Apple Music etc) and ""other"" (Apple watch, Beats headphones, AirPods, plus whatever else they're working on).

So even if the market dips, my wager is that AAPL will dip LESS that the average tech stock.  They understand how to nurture R&D and flow it into products.  While Cook may be a less charismatic company manager than Jobs, he has done a good job of infusing growth into the corporate R&D and engineering culture.

I encourage discussion.",sb7y71,17,2022-01-24 08:04:34
Cramer just said to start buying solid real-world real assets real earnings stocks,"He didn't specifiy AAPL. VIAC was the only one he mentioned by name as a clear buy (down 5% on Netflix's woes but Paramount Plus, HBO Plus etc are the source of Netflix's woes, taking audience share).  INTC CEO also did a piece on CNBC sounding very convincing about the viability of modest PE legacy tech giants like itself and AAPL.   

We could also see a bargain basement shopping spree for buyers of companies like Apple.  If they want Peloton for instance, they can now buy it for 50% off.  So we shall see if Apple goes shopping or just continues buying back its own stock as they have been doing.  In fact I bet Apple buys back billions in AAPl share today.",s9bexu,7,2022-01-21 22:02:35
Dark day but the storm will pass soon and the future remains very bright for Apple,"Welcome to correction territory, but the future remains bright for AAPL and its little sister SWKS which I also own. down to the bottom for both, it appears. However, this severe risk-off mentality based on general pessimism in the world (especially the rise of fascism in the GOP and the impending Russian invasion of Ukraine which looks likely, so a new USSR?) plus a lot of gouging making inflation worse, the democrats agenda all blocked by Manchin and Sinema, covid unpredictable as hell, anti vaxxer anti maskers rebelling and many still dying, well it is a bad day on the planet or a bad week or two.

Negative psychology can hit the market in unexpected ways. But there is a big silver lining and once those storm clouds pass, we will see sharp upward movement at least with well-deserving stocks like AAPl and SWKS.  for one thing we have earnings in 8 days.  Earnings cut through the BS usually, According to what I can surmise, Apple has had a wonderful quarter with huge growth in China and many other countries which didn't used to be Apple strongholds.  can they keep up with demand?  Well maybe not quite, but I hear they have pretty much solved their supply chain problems of late.

Covid was bad this last month, but remember what happened during the worst covid shutdowns?  Apple benefitted greatly.  despite the fact the anti masker anti vaxx GOP is demanding that schools re-open unprotected (fools) 100,000 students in Miami-Dade alone didn't show up for class because our anti vaxxer governor Desantis made it too dangerous.  So how are those kids learning? On iPads and iPHones and Macs.  Plus 5G just premiered and despite problems around airports (real or imagined) the 5G super cycle has just begun, and not only AAPl and SWKS will benefit but also T ad VZ which are very cheap stocks now.

So two steps back, three steps forward for AAPL?  And will bears take it down even more before earnings just because they can?   If you, a great buying op is presenting itself and the future remains just as bright as when AAPL was at 182. In fact, if this negativity lasts another week, then AAPL will announce earnings perhaps at the near term bottom and then we might see something like we saw years ago when apple beat and the stock went up 20%.  We shall see.",s815ya,12,2022-01-20 05:32:33

"Sell-off likely over now, 3.5 days of selling, bottoms being put in","As Jim Kramer says these tech sell-offs usually last 3-4 days and no longer and wash out the weak hands and short-term momentum traders. 173 seems to be the short term bottom and maybe the bottom for the future as well. That is not bad at all.  If it dips again, well then 168 held during the last sell-off so that is probably as low as she will go. 

I already see beaten down high-fliers start to rebound sharply so AAPL will likely go up tomorrow.  Nothing to worry about, but if you want AAPl shares it id a good day to buy. I remain 100% bullish and also let's be real, a small interest rate hike isn't going to put a single blemish on Apple.  For one thing, Apple has so much money it acts as a kind of bank itself loaning out corporate bond money all over the place. PLus wth inflation Apple also has pricing power. They could raise the price of an iPhone $100 and no one would care.",rxi8ia,13,2022-01-07 00:14:00

AAPL 2022 Overview,"Apple is a backbone to a successful portfolio with calls 6 months out and holding shares are the best play. Nothing can stop the company from future growth. Next year will be huge for the Mac, iPhone, and VR. Apple is a computer company at the core and will release it's most powerful chips and most powerful work stations ever. iPhone will get a redesign and iPad should see some updates. AAPL is the biggest stock in the market and will continue to grow to $10 trillion price target may take a couple years but eyes on the prize. Short term ascending wedge bullish. Good luck and make that apple cash $$$$

Why I invest in Apple,"Was talking with my friends earlier in the week and one of my friends who was always an android user told me he bought an iPhone. He said that he uses it as his phone for picking up girls. Apparently, lots of (younger) girls view green text as a turnoff. 

I thought it was nonsense at first but I asked around. Apparently it's at least somewhat true. I don't think that this is a reflection of how most Gen z females think at all, but the fact that there's so many people out there that view iPhone and Apple products as status symbols just means one thing: 💵💵.

Frankly I think these people are pompous, ignorant pricks but I love it. Apple has created a lifestyle with a cult like following. Not just an iPhone or an iPad. A lifestyle.",roisec,18,2021-12-26 06:21:36

There could be period where people liquidate their APPL gains from the past couple of months posing an opportunity to buy AAPL at a lower price (for a short time).

Apple to Roll Out Crash Detection Feature for iPhones, Watches in 2022

You could also add the fact TSLA now has  361 pe and no chance at all to grow more than 50% and then run into plenty of stiff competition. Yes I know Musk is a cult figure and the market plays favorites all the time. But over time, real earnings and stock prices are what matters.  AAPL is enduring the supply chain slowdown now, but who isn't?  MSFT and TSLA are as well, in fact the entire economy is. Plus unlike other companies, any lot sales for Apple this quarter simply get pushed ahead to the next one, so they really don't lose anything.  My point is that in terms of mega cap tech at least, AAPL is the only one which is undervalued and it appears to be undervalued by at least 25%.  Comments?",qjx3kk,31,2021-11-01 03:42:55

Globalstar Shares Soar on Rumors of iPhone 13 Satellite Calling Linkup,"Globalstar (GSAT) shares jumped more than 42% Monday morning after reports named the mobile satellite services provider as a ""likely partner"" for Apple's (AAPL) new iPhone 13, which is expected to support satellite calling.

The iPhone 13 will use Qualcomm's (QCOM) X60 baseband chip to connect to low earth orbit satellites, Apple Insider reported Sunday, citing a research note by Ming-Chi Kuo, analyst for Hong Kong-based TF International Securities.

""There are many potential scenarios for Apple's business model cooperation with Globalstar,"" Apple Insider quoted from the research note. ""The simplest scenario is that if the user's operator has already teamed with Globalstar, the user can directly use Globalstar's satellite communication service on the iPhone 13 through the operator's service.""",peoz9s,5,2021-08-31 03:15:11

My 3rd Quarter Results Apple Notes,"Apple 3rd Quarter Results Notes - 


Apple is an eco-system company with products and services intertwined into a fruitful symbiotic relationship.


7/28/2021

Astounding revenue and earnings growth of 36% and 101%, respectively, in fiscal Q3. Beat revenue consensus by more than $8 billion and Apple had not provided explicit guidance for the quarter.


Specifically, for fiscal 3Q21 (calendar 2Q21), Apple posted revenue of $81.4 billion, which was up 37% year-over-year. Revenue far exceeded the consensus forecast of $73.3 billion. GAAP earnings totaled $1.30 per diluted share, up 100% from $0.65 a year earlier. GAAP EPS was $0.34 above the consensus call of $1.01.


Shares were down -1.2% after the quarterly report, after having dipped another -1.5% on earnings day itself.


_________________________________________________
Argus

Continued broad-based momentum; reiterating BUY Apple meaningfully topped fiscal 3Q21 consensus expectations, including beating the revenue consensus by more than $8 billion. 


Apple posted June-quarter sales records in multiple product categories and regions, while posting all-time high revenue in services. We look for the coming second-generation 5G iPhone launch, tentatively called iPhone 13, to feature new M2 chips replacing 'Bionic' (A series) chips as iPhone's central processor.


AAPL has had a quiet and market-lagging start to the calendar year. In our view, the relative underperformance reflects sector rotation, not any misfires in Apple's leadership franchises. We therefore regard the underperformance as an opportunity to establish or dollar-average into positions in AAPL. We are reiterating our BUY rating and 12-month target price of $165.

Oppenheimer Adjusts Apple PT to $165 From $160, Maintains Outperform Rating	

Oppenheimer increased its price target on Apple (AAPL) to $165 from $160 on impressive sales momentum across hardware categories, with iPhone growing 50% y/y, while Mac and iPad 16% and 12%, respectively.

The brokerage said it believes the company will show stronger resistance to competition with its expanding hardware and software ecosystem. It expects the company's significant leadership in accessories such as Apple Watch and AirPods to provide incremental sales growth, deeper moat for core iOS devices, upside for software and network service sales.

""At the current stage of smartphone competition, we see little risk of share loss and view shifts in iPhone replacement cycle immaterial,"" said the brokerage, noting that longer term it sees tremendous value in the Apple ecosystem and its ability to monetize its user base.

Apple's Stellar Q3 Raises Q4 Bar Despite Expected $4 Billion Hit From Supply Shortages, Says Goldman Sachs	

Apple's (AAPL) strong fiscal Q3 results could have been stronger if not for the substantial supply constraints the consumer technology giant faced during the period, Goldman Sachs said in a reasearch note.

The iPhone maker late Tuesday reported fiscal Q3 earnings of $1.30 per diluted share, up from $0.65 a year ago and ahead of the average analyst EPS estimate of $1.01 in a Capital IQ survey. Revenue surged to $81.4 billion from $59.7 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected $73.5 billion.

While Apple said chip supply shortages crimped Q3 revenue by less than the company's projection of $3 billion to $4 billion, it expects a bigger hit to fiscal Q4 revenue.

Goldman said chip shortages could reduce Q4 revenue by $4 billion.

The iPhone's fiscal Q3 revenue of $40 billion outpaced Goldman analysts' estimate as the line continues to be the main driver of Apple's revenue, fueled by growth in unit volume as well as average selling prices, the firm said. As a result, Goldman analysts raised their Q4 iPhone revenue estimate by 22%, projecting 71% year-over-year growth.

Growth in Apple's wearables, home and accessories segment are also very robust at 36% year-over-year, likely benefiting from the reopening of Apple stores, the firm said.

Goldman raised its forecasts for fiscal 2021 to 2023, now projecting Apple's fiscal Q4 revenue at $89.3 billion, from $83.1 billion previously. Consensus compiled by Capital IQ calls for revenue of $84.1 billion.

Goldman raised its projection for Apple's fiscal Q4 per-share earnings to $1.32 from $1.12 previously. Consensus compiled by Capital IQ calls for Q4 adjusted earnings of $1.21 a share.

Apple shares were slightly higher in after-hours trade Wednesday after losing 1.2% in the regular session.

Deutsche Bank Adjusts Apple PT to $175 From $165, Maintains Buy Rating	

Deutsche Bank increased its price target on Apple (AAPL) to $175 from $165 following Q3 beat and raised Q4 outlook.

According to the brokerage the company's revenue growth of 36% y/y in Q3 was driven mainly by iPhone (revenue growth of 50% y/y), but the performance across other products was healthy too, with all product segments growing revenue in the double-digits.

The brokerage said that it is also encouraged to see the company continuing to see strong demand in emerging markets, particularly in China, and this remains a meaningful opportunity for future share gains.

And the upgrades continue across the board

Additional fiscal 3Q21 detail

Regionally, fears of a weak showing in Greater China revenue proved unfounded as revenue from the region rose 58% annually. All other regions posted revenue growth in the 29%-34% range, including the Americas at 44% of sales, the largest region.

iPhone generated revenue of $39.6 billion representing 49% of total revenue which was a record for any June quarter and up 50%
year-over-year; notably, iPhone sales were about $4 billion above consensus. 

Since 2016, the 2Q-to-3Q sequential trend in iPhone has been an average 20% decline. But for the preceding two years of FY19 and FY20, the decline has been a more moderate 12% and just 9% in FY20. Fiscal 3Q21 iPhone revenue declined 17% from 2Q21, the first full quarter of 5G iPhones. 

Appears iPhone is strongest in the U.S., where it has chased away many other premium and mid-tier Android smartphones. The next largest revenue category, Services, posted all-time record revenue of $17.49 billion which represented 21% of total revenue; Services revenue
was up 33% annually and 3% sequentially. A key driver for services is the base of installed Apple devices, which once again hit a new all-time record.

Apple has more than 700 million paid subscriptions across all its platforms, which is four-times the number of paid subscriptions four years ago.

Wearables, Home & Accessories (WH&A) surprisingly moved into the number 3 revenue category in fiscal 3Q21, ahead of Mac and iPad. WH&A revenue of $8.78 billion. Growth was aided by new products including Apple TV 4K and Air Tags.

Mac revenue, 10% of total revenue was up 16% annually and down 10% sequentially. We believe the M1 chip has and will reinvigorate Mac sales going forward, particularly with the new macOS dubbed 'Monterey.' Like other products that are semiconductor-dependent, Mac faced supply constraints, yet still set a June-quarter revenue record.

iPad revenue, 9% of total revenue was up 12% annually and down a less than seasonal 6% sequentially. We believe putting the M1 chip
in the new iPad Pro has stimulated interest in this product in time for the resurgence in enterprise IT spending. 

In addition to a 7% increase in its quarterly dividend and a $90 billion increase in its share repurchase authorization announced in April 2021, Apple committed to $430 billion in U.S investments over a five-year period while adding 20,000 new U.S. jobs. It has also accelerated debt retirement.


Cash & short and long term investments were $193.6 billion at the end of fiscal 3Q21. 

Cash was $191.8 billion at the end of FY20
Cash was $205.9 billion at the end of FY19
Cash was $237.1 billion at the end of FY18

"Apple Gaining China Market Share Amid iPhone Shipments Surge, Says Morgan Stanley","8/18/2021

Apple (AAPL) is winning market share in China, with iPhone shipments in the country up 79% year-over-year in July versus 27% for Chinese smartphone vendors, Morgan Stanley said Wednesday in a research note citing data from China's Academy for Information and Communications Technology.

Apple's July gain is a big improvement from Q2, when iPhone shipments in China declined 4% from a year earlier, said Morgan Stanley analysts including Katy Huberty.

The iPhone gained 90 basis points of installed base share in China year-over-year, ending July at a 27-month-high of nearly 21%, Morgan Stanley said, citing data from third-party vendor Jiguang.

The older iPhone 11 models make up more than 21% of Apple's installed base in China despite the popularity of the newer iPhone 12 models, Morgan Stanley noted. ""These data points support our view that the iPhone can see continued shipment strength after the launch of the new iPhone 13 model in September/October,"" the analysts said.",p8ddx2,15,2021-08-21 04:34:14

The iPhone maker said it will inform the staff about the reopening of offices a month in advance. Upon their return, the staffers would be required to work at least three days a week at the office, with remote work on the remaining two days.

Buying pressure is clearly depleting, as those early investors are slowly, quietly selling, whilst CNCB and the likes scream buy apple stock you cant go wrong. Also, the STOCK IS NOT THE COMPANY AND THE COMPANY IS NOT THE STOCK. I would DEFINITELY not recommend getting in now, idc what anyone says, we have been in a inflated, money inflated bubble for the past year, and the euphoria is getting to people. If your a HODL type of investor, i would recommend at least cashing out 10-20% to realise some gains, profit is profit. Here are the charts:

So now the stock is riding in between 140-145 and i am thinking of selling my shares and want to re-buy as soon as it drops back to the 125-ish mark. 

I have no idea if this will be a smart move, due to the dividend growth you gain for holding.

"Morgan Stanley Ups Apple to $162 From $161, Sees Concerns as Overblown, Maintains Overweight","Morgan Stanley Ups Apple to $162 From $161, Sees Concerns as Overblown, Maintains Overweight	

June 24, 2021


Apple received a slight boost to its price target from Morgan Stanley as the firm said investors' concerns about the consumer technology company's fiscal 2022 growth prospects are ""overblown"" and create a long-term buying opportunity.

Morgan Stanley's new price target on Apple's stock is $162 per share, up from $161. In comparison, the shares closed Wednesday's session at $133.70. Morgan Stanley kept its investment rating on the shares at overweight.

""Investors are concerned about AAPL's FY22 growth prospects given the expectation for an iPhone super-cycle and waning cyclical [work-from-home] tailwinds"", Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to clients. However, they added, ""we're not as concerned and see a good long-term buying opportunity.""

The firm pointed to four main factors making investors cautious about Apple. First, ""we are at a seasonally low period in the iPhone cycle, which creates a demand information vacuum and elevates the relative impact of supply chain noise,"" Morgan Stanley said. ""Second, Apple is increasingly in the eyes of regulators, and while we believe their model is defensible... regulatory risk is likely to remain a stock overhang.""

Third, the firm said, ""as the world slowly returns to normal, there are concerns that cyclical work-and-learn-from-home demand will decelerate at the same time Apple faces increasingly difficult"" comparisons. Finally, ""investors fear that a more evolutionary (rather than revolutionary) iPhone super-cycle will lead to extending iPhone replacement cycles and [year-over-year] revenue declines next year.""

The Morgan Stanley analysts said they recognize these risks but have a more positive outlook on Apple. For the near term, the firm is calling for the June-ended quarter to be stronger than originally expected, which prompted it to increase estimates for the quarter's revenue and earnings per share.",o7bzpm,12,2021-06-25 07:50:53

Wedbush - IPhone Supercycle Growth Story Can Continue Into FY22,"June 21, 2021 -

Wedbush expects the iPhone supercycle growth story to continue into 2022, with the recent model likely to launch in the third week of September.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reiterated his outperform rating and $185 price target on the stock Monday.

Apple's (AAPL) stock has ""underperformed so far this year as the Street remains unconvinced"" regarding the pace of the iPhone 13's supercycle, Ives noted in a report to clients, but Asia supply chain builds for the model -- now at 90 million to 100 million units -- seem to indicate the company's ""increased confidence"" that this 5G product cycle will extend ""well into 2022.""

Ives cited an expected boost from a ""reopening environment,"" as well as ""massive pent-up demand,"" given the approximately 250 million iPhones that have not been upgraded in at least 3.5 years.

Ives also highlighted the approximately ""$20 per share overhang"" on the stock, due to ""antitrust and regulatory concerns on the Street,"" particularly with the Epic Games lawsuit verdict and the appointment of Lina Khan as head of the Federal Trade Commission. That said, the antitrust headwind is likely a ""containable headline risk,"" while ""the App Store remains a very defendable moat.""",o5qujx,11,2021-06-23 00:16:40

My Apple Stock Repurchase Notes/Computation,"April 30, 2020 - Q2 2020: AAPL Board authorized $50 billion for share repurchases in addition to the over $40 billion authorization remaining under the current share repurchase plan.

So, $90 billion repurchase authorized/remaining at the end of Q2 2020

Q3 2020: Repurchased $16 billion Q4 2020: Repurchased $18 billion

Q1 2021: Repurchased $24 billion Q2 2021: Repurchased $19 billion

16+18+24+19 = $77 billion $90 billion was remaining/authorized, so $13 billion remaining

April 28, 2021 - Q2 2021: Authorized an increase of $90 billion to existing share repurchase program.

$13 billion remaining + $90 billion increase = $103 billion share repurchase

$103,000,000,000 authorized-remaining / $130 per share price = 792,307,692 to be retired

Inflection point coming for the stock,"There will be an inflection point coming. Bill Gates sold **all** his shares, Cathie Wood sold shares in aapl.  Buffett said he sold more than he should.  Who is still going to have shares to sell? This stock is setting itself up for reversal.  I don't know when, but it will happen.  Only hedge funds/big money when they are going to go back long.  I believe it is before end of the year.   

Their earnings are better than ever.  The reasoning that ""inflation will hurt tech returns"" is questionable at best. Appl could increase prices and people would still buy.  They also are making way more than expected in the app store if anyone if following the case. 

So to buy a car right now I have to pay 2 to 4k over sticker.  But appl is worth 10% less? Anyone else see irony here.  If true inflation is here, aapl is worth well over 3 T.   This is aapl at 180$.

Using wave theory to make sense of what we have seen in AAPL stock,"&#x200B;

Hey Guys

This video / analysis may or may not be liked here, but it will hopefully shed some light on what we have been seeing with aapl stock and potentially where it could be going. Aapl stock has been in a 7 swing correction since the ATH's reached several months ago. There is a chance that when the market pulls back aapl could get to 110 range before a ton of buyers step in. I do believe that a back to tech rotation will happen after the next leg down, so there is light at the end of the tunnel.

If interested in my analysis please see video at link below

Note: I am not a financial advisor and I do not short aapl stock. I am long the stock but use wave theory to pick scalp and cut loss points.

Hedge Funds Selling,"Continues to prove the hedge funds and big money are selling aapl. When are they going to be done selling? Why are they holding this stock down when it's best stock in the world? It's only a matter of time before this stock starts heading higher. This stock is consistently down when more buying at brokerages like Fidelity.  When is their flip date? Are they going to wait until fall? When they decide to go long, this stock is going to head higher.  I don't know the flip date. But it is coming sooner than later, buy aapl and hold for the flip.

ETF podcast (not my own) episode,"I listened to a podcast with a guy from the LOUP etf talking about big tech. He was most bullish on Apple out of the big tech companies.

He said that he predicted earlier this year Apple would have the best year out of all the big tech companies (he specifically talked about Google, FB, AMZN, and Netflix). They haven't, but he is sticking by his estimate.  He thinks they still have some major catalysts coming, particularly VR.

You can listen here if you'd like. He doesn't spend a lot of time talking about Apple but the guy was totally confirming my own opinions (I was like, is this me?).

It is a good podcast that I'd recommend.  I am not in any way affiliated with it.

I have been an Apple fan since 2008 when I got introduced to them, I love watching their keynotes and all press media related things. It's just a company I enjoy seeing grow and I guess I wanted my first stock pick to be a business I enjoy and love learning about.

Question!,"Okay so I own 39 AAPL shares at an average cost of $125.68. I truly believe in the long term future of AAPL and am definitely not selling for a long long time. 

My philosophy is everyday AAPL goes below my current average I will buy another share to bring my average down. 

My question is that with the lawsuit stuff going on should instead of buying a share a day if it’s below my average should I wait to see if there is a massive dip and then buy a bunch of shares at once?

I know 39 shares and adding 1 share when it is down is probably child’s play to a lot of the people in this community but it is a good amount for me!

AAPL just got another affirmation from the Buffet at the Berkshire’s Annual Meeting.,"“Buffett said selling some Apple stock last year was ‘probably a mistake’

Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett admitted selling a small part of its Apple stock in 2020 was a misstep. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Berkshire trimmed its Apple stake by just 3.7% to about 944 million shares.

“We got a chance to buy it and I sold some stock last year...that was probably a mistake,” said Buffett.

The “Oracle of Ohama” went on to to say that Apple’s stock is a “huge, huge bargain.” “It is indispensable to people,” Buffett said.

“The part it plays in their lives is huge,” he said. “A car costs $35,000 and I’m sure with some people if you asked them whether they wanted to give up, had to give up, their Apple, they’d give up their car.”

Apple is the largest position in Berkshire’s investment portfolio, in a bet worth nearly $111 billion.

counter strike strategy against price-pin from big players/hedge funds on $AAPL that fck up your Options plays.,"IMO

This isn't 2020 where Options plays were so easy that middle school kids can be profitable month after month, too!

You already have seen price-pin move played out on last Friday Feb/26th.

The most effective counter strike strategy against price-pin is **buy shares and not Options** for a **more ""consistent"" profit$** forever as long as the company have strong fundamental that keep beating earnings and you buy low, smartly accumulating shares, sell high later or continue building up your shares. You can play Options Wheel, but I do not recommend it over build long shares with AAPL. And **time is your best friend** with this strategy while it's killing big players or any hedge funds pinning $AAPL price at lower prices!

There is a flaw in price pinning strategy on stock like $AAPL. At this low price range, Big Players/Hedge Funds have to short or willing to sell their shares at a low price or do both to pin the price at a certain range. When price pinning happened, **they let time kills Options players** with weekly expiration date. However, **there's limit to how long and how low they can keep $AAPL down.** They fear Apple buybacks power and bigger investor like Warren Buffett stepping in stealing their shares at the low price they have sold out or getting big losses on their shorting $AAPL. Thus this is the perfect time for Retail Players to strike, buying and accumulating shares during big players price pinning strategy. When they cover their shorts or buy back share combining with retail players accumulating shares, the price will shoot up quickly. When they repeat their price pin strategy, Retail Players counter strike it by buying their share for cheap and holding it without time limit. As this continue it creates a higher-low reversal pattern from the bottom in favor of those players that have been accumulating shares at the lows or bottoms. **Don't ever do bottom ticking to go all in!** Buy low, smartly accumulate shares, sell high later if you wanted! That is how you stay consistently profitable with $AAPL.

Goes trade other high-flying stock like TSLA, AMZN, etc. Take the profits and build up long shares in high value growth stock like $AAPL.

**Unless $AAPL fundamentals are changing for the worst, keeps on buying at these low range!**

Looks like a sell trapt...institutions playing retail players like a childplay fools.,"IMO:

Institutions are getting shares from the little retail players for cheap as retailers continue to sell thinking aapl will drop to $100-$110 range based on articles they read and talking heads media. 🤔

Articles that said they are shorting Apple are for morons to believe in. 🙄 pro traders don't short Apple cuz there're much more better and safer short stocks out there to profit from.

10 year bond yields rising and sectors rotation are over played and priced in so much already. Although rising B-yields are not good for tech sector (mainly riskier small to mid cap stocks) but not too much so for Apple. The real B-yield is minus inflation # is still equal to negative b-yields, meaning equity, growth stocks with dividends like Apple, is still and will continue to be more attractive to institutions even when they rotating to rebalance their portfolios.

Many Amateurs options players will continue to get burned 🔥 with their random lucks and trends speculations for a short time periods; while traders and longs in aapl ""SHARES"" continue to profits ""consistently"" both long and short terms in aapl!

Aapl shares traders are at least 90% to always never get a loss trade...mostly profitable year by year!!!

Invest/buy/accumulate aapl at these levels today with absolute confidence!

I invest in AAPL since 1996. My today suggestion is you HOLD.  It can go even at 115 but it’s hard to fall below 105. 

This quarter will test the limits of the stock. It’s nothing unexpected. The bears will try and make you sell. Don’t ! 

Even if we roll this way and reach pre split figures, rest assured that there will be a bounce. A good sign will be an above or an at least 10% increase on dividends. And don’t forget that we have 100$ billion in buybacks and APPLE loves to buy on the downsides. And remember to check on the daily volumes. All this drag favours the long timers and the hedge funds.

scenario 2.) when big boys willing to sell most of their shares at a loss (like you amateurs options players) in a company, it's because they see a crack in its fundamentals -- it's bearish and time to dump your shares and run for the hill!

aapl is scenario 1!!!

Why aapl dropping after a kick ass earning q4?,"IMO:

Quick summary

1. Crush earning expectations but no guidance, that's equal to a no no for big players! So at $145 ath before earning the price already priced in for them pro to take profits while amateurs got burned with their options play speculations.

2. Sector rotation, big boys took some profits to balance their portfolios. Plus big shorts hedge funds need to cover their losses from meme stocks AMC/GME etc. From profits taken from faang stocks.

3. Government-bond-yields rising which is not good for technology stocks, cuz they benefit from low interest rate. This is making Institutions reassessing their risky plays on over-valued stocks. 

Eventually they will move back to safe haven, high-growing stock like aapl.

Overall this create a good opportunity to buy and accumulated at these level as up right now!!!
